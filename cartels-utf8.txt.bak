<i>Preface</i>


Plastics, television, new chemical and electrical techniques
are but a few of the instruments which will furnish the stuff for
the pioneers of a new age. The challenge of housing will excite
bold minds to action, on a scale never before attempted, to wipe
out slums and give dwellers in country and city alike a new and
higher standard of living. Not only at home, but also abroad,
the opportunities for daring enterprise which will be offered by
the needs of world reconstruction will surpass anything ever
before known.

How are we going to meet this challenge? At the outset, we
must face frankly the greatest obstacle to making the most of
our opportunity. It is the threat of cartel control of major
world industries. Unless this threat is understood and dealt
with decisively, our opportunity to realize the great potential
benefits of a free economy will be lost. And worse still, the
hope of maintaining democratic political institutions will be
seriously impaired.

The pattern of cartel operations has been clearly revealed in
recent years by antitrust investigations. From public records in
antitrust proceedings and congressional hearings, information
about cartel operations is now available. The public should be
familiar with the facts. As head of the Antitrust Division of
the Department of Justice, I have frequently been called upon
to discuss cartel problems before congressional committees,
trade associations and civic groups. Since my testimony and
speeches received varying degrees of public notice at the time
they were given, the casual reader of newspaper reports necessarily
obtained only an impressionistic picture of the far-flung
ramifications of the subject. Something more is needed for
thorough understanding.

With this thought in mind, a number of friends and associates
have suggested from time to time that my material should
be woven together in book form. This I have undertaken to
do in the present volume.

Merely to make assertions about the evil effect of cartels is a
simple matter. But I believe that the real usefulness of this
book will depend upon its fairly detailed explanation of the
operation of particular cartels, with direct quotations from letters,
memoranda and other documents.

While I have not tried to compile a complete source-book, I
have striven to make this discussion as non-technical as possible.
The factual material is drawn largely from the documents
of the Kilgore, Truman and Bone Senate Committees, and from
the public records of antitrust cases.

The investigations which unearthed the facts cited in this
book were, of course, the work of a great many men and women
in the Antitrust Division extending over a period of years.
Acknowledgment of credit to all of them would be impossible.
Many of the men who have developed these facts are now
serving their country in the armed forces.

I cannot praise too highly the ability, energy and devotion to
public service of the men and women of the Antitrust Division.
It is a privilege to head such a splendid staff, as it is to serve
under such an able and distinguished Attorney General as
Francis Biddle, who has maintained at all times an extremely
deep interest in our cartel work and has given it his fullest support.
Attorney General Biddle has repeatedly impressed upon
me his own conviction that the vigorous enforcement of the
antitrust laws against cartels is an indispensable condition to the
maintenance of a free competitive economy in this country.

In the preparation of this book I am particularly indebted to
Joseph Borkin of my staff, who is in my opinion one of the best
informed men in America on the activities of international cartels.
For more than five years Mr. Borkin has devoted his
great resourcefulness and energy to investigation and study of
cartel problems. His contribution in this field has been invaluable.

I also want to acknowledge my deep obligation to my First
Assistant, Edward H. Levi, with whom I have spent many
hours discussing the legal and economic problems of cartels, and
on whom I have relied so heavily in the practical administration
of the Antitrust Division. And I am greatly indebted to Myron
W. Watkins, Charles A. Welsh, Ernest S. Meyers, George P.
Comer, Herbert A. Berman, Bartholomew Diggins, Robert
Hunter, and Heinrich Kronstein of the Antitrust Division staff,
all of whom have been of great assistance in the preparation
of this book and in the cartel work of the Division. Professor
Walton Hamilton of Yale, who has been a part-time member
of the staff, has also worked closely with me on these
matters and has made a signal contribution to our work.

Mr. M. B. Schnapper, Executive Secretary of the American
Council of Public Affairs, has been of greatest assistance in the
planning of this book and in the editorial work which it has
involved.

<i>Trusts to Cartels</i>


The problem of monopoly is no longer a distinctively domestic
and national phenomenon. It has come to encompass the
wide world. Like a parasite upon its host, monopoly has grown
with the marketplace. Today hardly a corner of the world
remains free from the malignant influence of its latest and most
sinister form, the cartel. Diamonds discovered in Arkansas may
prompt agitated conferences within 48 hours in London and
the Belgian Congo; a lawsuit in New York challenging the
aluminum monopoly brings simultaneous outbursts of oratory
in the House of Lords and of vituperation on the Axis radio.

For over half a century, the Sherman Act has stood as a
positive expression of the inflexible will of the American people
to preserve freedom of economic opportunity. When this
measure was enacted the oil, whiskey, and sugar trusts had
placed barriers directly athwart the arteries of commerce and
were exacting tolls for every gallon or pound of product permitted
to pass. Since nation-wide industrial monopoly of a
comparatively stable character first took the form of a simple
trust agreement the Sherman Act came to be designated an antitrust
statute. But its thrust was positive: the maintenance of
free, competitive markets and a democratic system of industrial
control.

If such an Act were passed today, I am quite sure it would
be called an "Anti-Cartel Act." For our attention is at the
present time focused on industrial monopoly in a different form,
operating in a wider orbit. But our basic concern is the same.
We are as determined today as were our grandfathers, two
generations ago--indeed, as were the founders of the republic--to
countenance no infringement of the right to engage in any
legitimate enterprise and to conduct business without let or
hindrance from any self-constituted group presuming to monopolize
trade or industry.

The Sherman Act has proved an effective instrument no less
for dealing with the cartel problem than for curbing the trusts.
It must be conceded, however, that, in default of proper implementation
and appropriate supplementation, it has not fully
realized the salutary object for which it was designed. In particular,
our policies with regard to patents, trademarks, the
tariff, monetary and credit matters, interstate commerce, and
foreign trade, all have a direct bearing upon competition and
the pattern of industrial organization. They are important factors
conditioning the efficacy of a free market for performing its
basic economic functions. To our comparative neglect of the
incidence of these policies on the problem of maintaining healthful
competitive conditions in industry must be attributed a large
share of the responsibility for the difference between anti-trust
goal and business practice.

In these circumstances, cartels--which, in effect, are trusts
magnified to an international scale--have been able by clandestine
means to impress their sinister mark upon our economy.
In mobilizing for war, we discovered, almost too late, that they
were responsible for shortage after shortage of vital materials.
The fact is that they have retarded technological advance and
the introduction of improved devices and products, whenever
such developments seemed to threaten their vested interests
despite the fact that thereby national security might be jeopardized.
They have, indeed, obstructed and in no small measure
thwarted the declared foreign policies of the American government,
placing their own business interests above the public
interests.

In peace time, their high-price, restricted-output strategy has
impeded the advance of our living standards and general economic
well-being. Through the abuse of our patent system,
cartel controls have been established over large segments of
technology. With this leverage, industrial monopolies of international
compass have at times deliberately brought about the
deterioration of quality standards. When it might be to their
advantage in maintaining or exploiting their monopoly position,
they have adulterated their products to an extent and in a
manner endangering the health, and even the lives, of consumers.
Almost incredible as these assertions may be, they are
not subject to contradiction--the incontrovertible facts are clearly
set forth in Congressional investigations and in the evidence
in antitrust cases of the Department of Justice.

Cartels are in essence private governments which threaten
to subvert and even engulf duly constituted authority. In Germany,
Kaiserism and later Nazism received enormous impetus,
indeed decisive support, from the regimented, cartelized structure
of the national economy.

Totalitarianism represents simply the ultimate consummation
of cartelism--the final, full expression of the reactionary
forces stemming from special privilege. In totalitarian states all
industrial enterprise is subservient to the predatory interests and
fear-dominated will of a government which openly flouts the
democratic principle of consent of the governed. In the economic
sphere, the investment of fresh capital, the volume of
production, the prices to be charged, the markets to be served,
are determined by arbitrary decrees. Risk-taking, managerial
discretion, bargaining freedom, the essential elements of the
capitalistic system as we have known it, are absent. One can
neither start a new industry, launch a new enterprise, or change
one's occupation without first obtaining official consent. It is in
the nature of cartels that they should operate in a similar fashion,
even if in their application the devices used for consolidating
the vested interests of established concerns and throttling
the dynamic forces which economic freedom would release may
lack something of the rigor they exhibit under totalitarian
"leadership." In order to maintain their control over production
and prices cartels must determine who may enter the industry,
how they shall operate and where they may sell.

The basic American concept of free enterprise is the antithesis
of a cartelized market. Yet, all too frequently, some of our industrialists
have had the effrontery to attempt to promote a
pro-cartel policy by a specious appeal for free enterprise. The
pretension is that freedom to compete in trade must encompass
freedom to suppress competition! As though the right to start
a fire in order to heat a house must include the right to burn
down the house in complete disregard of the peril to the whole
community! The common sense of ordinary men has no difficulty
in distinguishing between the right to start a fire and the
"right" to commit arson.

Unless I am greatly mistaken, the American public will no
more tolerate a cartel-sanctioning abrogation of the antitrust
laws in the name of "free enterprise" than they would countenance
a repeal of the laws against arson in the name of "freedom
of self-preservation"--the right to keep warm!

It is significant, and deserves thoughtful reflection that Germany,
the "classic land of the cartel," where regimented economic
restrictionism is the accepted "way of life," has in the
course of two generations farrowed Kaiserism and Hitlerism--the
natural offspring of militarism and cartelism. Even in times
of peace, the militarists and industrial monopolists of Germany
found cartel restrictions an excellent means for conducting covert
warfare. In this way industrial "colonies" were acquired
and prospective victims "softened up." Back in 1883, Joseph
Chamberlain, as a member of the British Cabinet, declared, in
sponsoring a bill designed to forefend the sub-rosa "invasion"
tactics of imperialistic Germany:

"It has been pointed out especially in an interesting memorial
presented on behalf of the chemical industry that under the
present law it would have been possible, for instance, for the
German inventor of the hot blast furnace, if he had chosen to
refuse a license in England, to have destroyed almost the whole
iron industry of this country and to carry the business bodily
over to Germany. Although that did not happen in the case of
the hot blast industry, it had actually happened in the manufacture
of artificial colors connected with the coal products, and
the whole of that had gone to Germany because the patentees
would not grant a license in this country."

A quarter century later, Lloyd George, introducing a more
drastic bill for curbing these insidious depredations on strategically
vital British industries, pointed out:

"Big foreign syndicates have one very effective way of destroying
British industry. They first of all apply for patents on
a very considerable scale. They suggest every possible combination,
for instance, in chemicals, which human ingenuity can
possibly think of. These combinations the syndicates have not
tried themselves. They are not in operation, say, in Germany or
elsewhere.... A good many of these patents have been taken
out not for the purpose of working the patents in this country,
<i>but for the purpose of preventing their being worked</i>."

The "big foreign syndicates" to which George referred were,
of course, the German cartels.

The adroit strategy of stealthily sapping the industrial foundations
of the national security of countries capable of resisting
the German <i>drang nach</i> all-points-of-the-compass has been relentlessly
pursued and resourcefully developed, through thick
and thin, decade after decade. If the cartels are thwarted in the
use of the patent system as a weapon for disarming potential
competitors abroad, they may inveigle the intended victims of
German aggression to a 'simulated' love-feast at which the
latter are gorged with the poisoned food of production quotas,
technology restrictions, market-territory limitations, and pricing
inhibitions. What these tactics accomplished in the way of
immobilizing French industry is now a familiar story. To cite
the record of only three of the most strategic industries, through
cartel manipulations the Germans succeeded in (a) reducing the
relative output of French steel from substantial equality with
German output in 1926 to 40 percent thereof in 1938, (b) retarding
the growth of French aluminum production to a rate
which fell short of doubling the output in the same period,
while German production was increasing five-fold, and (c) restricting
the French dyestuffs industry in such fashion that its
output in 1937 was barely two-thirds of what it had been in
1924, whereas German production, even according to official
estimates (none too reliable though they are) had increased five
percent in the same period.

Nor were the European countries alone the "potential enemies"
whose vital economic defenses were thus impaired by
subtly imposed cartel restrictions. In this hemisphere, likewise
and not least of all in our own country, the cartel device was
sedulously--and effectively--used for the same ulterior purpose.
As President Woodrow Wilson declared shortly after the
first World War,

"Our complete dependence upon German [dyestuffs] supplies
before the war made the interruption of trade a cause of
exceptional economic disturbance. The close relation between
the manufacture of dyestuffs on the one hand and of explosives
and poisonous gases on the other, moreover, has given the industry
an exceptional significance.... It will ... be a policy of
obvious prudence to make certain of the successful maintenance
of many strong and well-equipped chemical plants. German
chemical industry, with which we will be brought into competition,
was and may well be again <i>a thoroughly knit monopoly,
capable of exercising a competition of a peculiarly insidious and
dangerous kind</i>."

Despite this warning in 1919, we were only slightly better
off, relatively, in respect of the arts of organic chemicals manufacture
twenty years later, when Germany decided the time was
ripe for another attempt at world conquest, than we had been
in 1917. In the matter of synthetic rubber technique, today the
most strategically critical of all these processes, I. G. Farben-*industrie
had succeeded, through its cartel arrangements with
the leading American firms in the petroleum and chemical
fields, in keeping this country in an extremely vulnerable position--as
all the world now knows. Partly through persistent
stalling tactics, partly through playing one American firm off
against another, partly through cajolery, and partly through
deliberate deceit, the German cartelists had not only stifled
the development of American technology in this field, even by
their "partners" on this side of the Atlantic, but had done even
better, from their standpoint. They had obtained the German
patent rights and the essential know-how for the most signal
contributions of American technicians to the art of synthetic
rubber manufacture. And, incredible though it may seem, they
had obtained these advantages without divulging a single significant
detail of their own carefully guarded know-how!

As the President's Office of Facts and Figures ruefully
summed up the situation in 1942:

"[The enemy] has worked for many years to weaken our
military potential. Through patent controls and cartel agreements
he succeeded in limiting American production and export
of many vital materials. He kept the prices of these materials up
and the output down. He was waging war, and he did his work
well, decoying important American companies into agreements,
the purpose of which they did not sense."

Thus, sixty years after a member of the British Cabinet first
testified to its awareness of the menace in the insidious penetration
of German cartels in the international sphere, a branch of
the American Executive confirms the continuing pertinence of
his observations.

How, in the face of this record, in the light of this evidence
of the persistence of the cartel movement and of its chronic
tendency to pervert the processes of industrial production to
ulterior ends leading indefeasibly to the devastation and slaughter
of war can it be contended that cartels represent a promising
way to order the post-war world economy? Is it not plain,
rather, that "if we would guide by the light of reason," we must
reaffirm our pledge of democratic equality of opportunity for
all in trade and industry, and resolutely set about the task of
putting our house in order in accordance with that basic principle
of American life? Is it not plain, too, that monopolistic industrial
control in the domestic sphere cannot be completely
achieved without the uprooting of the foci of cartel infection in
German industry? Once German industry is purged of its cartel
hook-ups and monopolistic animus and all non-German industry
is released from the haunting fears and seductive temptations
which go so far to explain these international industrial alliances,
I am confident that the prospects for the restoration of
genuine freedom of enterprise and healthy competitive markets
will be good. While I am not sanguine of the goal being
reached forthwith and easily, "at one bound" as it were, I have
an abiding faith that the dynamism of economic freedom will
enable us, in the end, to surmount every obstacle erected by
special privilege or vested interest on the highroad to full utilization
of resources. A truly great adventure is ahead.

<i>Enterprise Eclipsed</i>


It is the determination of our people not only to gain victory
over the military power of aggressors, but to establish securely
the lasting conditions of peace. We know that beyond victory
we shall have to face a multitude of perplexing economic problems.
We must also realize that we shall meet new dangers to
those free institutions on which our national economy is based.
If the problems of peace are to be solved, we shall have to come
to grips with these difficulties in the same spirit of resolution
with which the war has been waged.

It seems abundantly clear that America can never have a
foreign policy based on the principles of democracy and international
good will as long as international trade is dominated
by cartels. It does not seem possible that the Atlantic Charter,
the Good Neighbor policy, and the reciprocal trade pacts can
effectively prevail if the special privileges of cartels dominate
trade and politics in the postwar world.

In many respects cartels form one of the central issues of the
present period. The greatest threat to our success in achieving
full production and full employment at home, and friendly co-*operation
with other nations abroad, is the philosophy and practice
of privilege embodied in cartels. If there is to be a free and
productive economy in the United States, or a free exchange of
goods in world markets, the power of cartels must be broken.

It is essential to understand that cartels seek to divide and
rule world industry on the basis of economic privilege. If cartels
are successful in gaining a foothold in the postwar period,
it will almost be impossible for this nation to maintain a high
level of peacetime production or to cooperate in the reconstruction
of world trade.

In general, cartels restrict rather than promote trade. Cartels
typically engage in such practices as dividing fields of operation
and market areas between members so as to eliminate competition,
restricting production by agreement, and fixing prices so as
to avoid price competition. They also promote various kinds of
patent licensing contracts which enable them to control and limit
the use of new inventions and thus restrict the benefits of technological
advance. The effects of these practices include reduced
production and employment, higher prices and profits, retarded
spread of technological improvements and a lower standard
of living.

The conduct of cartels before and during this war has been
one of the tragic pages of our history. The shortages of aluminum
and magnesium resulting from cartel restrictions forced us
to strip the kitchens of America and scar our public squares with
scrap piles. The scarcity of rubber is a never-ceasing threat to
our productive effort. Our armed forces plead with us to
contribute our binoculars. The lack of vital drugs and medicines
has jeopardized our men fighting in fever stricken areas.
In fact, almost wherever there was a cartel there was a shortage.

But cartels have an even more serious aspect. These private
governments threaten the sovereignty of democratic nations.
The political implications of cartel activity threaten to subvert
future national public policy of the United States.

There is a close relation between a country's economic policies
and its foreign relations. It is generally recognized now that
economic freedom cannot be attained at home if private groups
are permitted to acquire monopoly power over industry. Likewise,
it must be equally recognized that friendship and cooperation
between this country and other nations cannot be established
without the free exchange of goods and services. Reciprocal
trade treaties and good neighbor policies can have little effect
if private cartels can shut off American markets to foreign producers
or prevent American producers from selling abroad.

The Good Neighbor policy is one of the fundamental principles
of our relations with Latin America. While our Government
was bending every effort to bring about the conditions of
sound and mutually advantageous cooperation, cartels were
systematically undermining these efforts. Latin America was
turned over by private cartels as a colony to hostile foreign interests.
By giving German industry virtually a free hand in
Latin America, and by agreeing not to compete, American cartelists
made possible the creation of a German sphere of influence.
Nazi propaganda, espionage, and subversive activity all
stem directly from this unhampered German penetration.
When South Americans sought to purchase drugs, metals, precision
equipment, and munitions from the United States, private
cartel treaties had already provided that American concerns
could not engage in this trade. Not only was the healthy development
of South American trade and industry checked, but
even today we struggle desperately to overcome the political
consequences of cartel activity.

We have long cherished the principle of open covenants
openly arrived at. In fact, this policy is an essential part of
America's conduct of foreign affairs. Every treaty commitment
made by this country is debated publicly by the people's representatives.
Without the agreement of two-thirds of the Senate
and the President, no treaty may be made. Yet agreements
have been made in international industry affecting both the
American economy and our foreign policy which were secretly
contrived and clandestinely arrived at. The American people
had no voice, but they bore the burden of these private treaties.

Make no mistake--the war has not interfered with cartel
plans. Cartel agreements invariably provide for the contingency
of war. Long before the war, cartels worked out a modus
vivendi--a method of continued existence--for they felt that
their relations must be preserved, war or no war. Thus we find
American and British cartelists agreeing to preserve the German
position in Latin American markets after the war. Agreements
between the cartel members of countries now at war provide for
a resumption at the war's close. In case legislation or government
action interfere, then they will cooperate to adapt their
relations, as one agreement states, "in the spirit of the present
agreements."

Therefore, the necessity for vigorous action in keeping open
the channels of trade becomes apparent when we consider that
those who create cartels hold themselves above the law or seek
to control legislation and Government policy in the many countries
where they operate.

These same groups are making their own postwar plans. Because
they have found the enforcement of the Sherman Act a
hindrance in the past they have expressed a desire to have the
antitrust laws repealed.

It should be recalled that the political deal which Munich
represented had its economic counterpart in one made at Dusseldorf,
in which the Federation of British Industries and the
German industrial overlords expressed their intention of stabilizing
and rationalizing world trade. As indicated at Dusseldorf,
cartel groups regard governments as handy instruments
to be used in working out their schemes of restriction.

Although the peace of Munich has received considerable public
consideration, little attention has been given to the peace of
Dusseldorf, a peace which, while obscured in the welter of political
and military crises, epitomized the spirit and the power of
international industrial monopoly.

On March 15 and 16, 1939, immediately after Hitler's invasion
of Czechoslovakia, representatives of the Reichsgruppe
Industrie of Germany and of the Federation of British Industries
held an intensive conference at Dusseldorf. At the conclusion
of the conference representatives of German and British
industry issued the following joint declaration:

"The Reichsgruppe Industrie and the Federation of British
Industries, having concluded a general discussion on Anglo-German
trade relations, issue the following agreed statement:

"1. The two organizations welcome the opportunity which
these discussions have given of developing still further the
friendly relations which have existed between the two bodies
for so many years.

<tb>

"4. The two bodies are agreed that the objective to be attained
is that the export of all countries should be conducted
in such a way as to ensure a fair return for the producers of those
countries. Hence it is agreed that it is essential to replace destructive
competition wherever it may be found by constructive
cooperation, designed to foster the expansion of world trade,
to the mutual benefit of Great Britain, Germany and all other
countries.

"5. The two organizations are agreed that it is desirable that
individual industries in both countries should endeavor to arrive
at industrial agreements which will eliminate destructive
competition, wherever occurring, but prices must be fixed at such
a level as not to diminish the buying power of the consumers.

"6. The two organizations realize that agreements upon
prices or other factors between Germany and Great Britain are
only a step, although a most important step, towards a more
ordered system of world trade. They would welcome the participation
of other nations in such agreements.

<tb>

"8. The two organizations realize that in certain cases the
advantages of agreements between the industries of two countries
or of a group of countries may be nullified by competition
from the industry in some other country that refuses to become
a party to the agreement. In such circumstances it may be necessary
for the organizations to obtain the help of their governments
and the two organizations agree to collaborate in seeking
that help.

"9. The two organizations agree that it is their objective to
ensure that as a result of an agreement between their industries
unhealthy competition shall be removed. Their aim is to secure
as complete cooperation as possible throughout the industrial
structure of their respective countries.

"10. The two organizations have agreed to use their best
endeavors to promote and foster negotiations between the individual
industries in their respective countries. They are encouraged
in this task owing to the fact that a considerable number
of agreements between individual German and British industrial
groups are already in existence. There is thus available
a large body of experience which inspires confidence that an immediate
extension of this policy is both practicable and advantageous.

"They are glad to state that approximately a further fifty
industrial groups have already signified their willingness in
principle to negotiate at an early date.

"They also report with satisfaction that negotiations have already
been started and are now taking place between ten industrial
groups."

The spirit exemplified in the above declaration is not dead.
It is awaiting the moment of peace to step in and resume control
of those very industries which are most essential to the rehabilitation
of a war-torn world, to the fullest use of our labor
and resources.

Surely we must realize now that if the program of Dusseldorf
prevails in the postwar world it will produce World War
III. Surely we must recognize that we cannot build a free
world without a free economy.

The close and constant cooperation of the United Nations
after the war is all-important. This cooperation should rest,
among other things, on active and healthy international trade.
We want to see that trade grow unhampered by private restrictions.
In attacking these illegal activities the Government
of the United States is aiming at a condition which obstructs
healthy international trade and threatens the effectiveness of
governmental foreign policies.

To combat the influence of monopoly groups, the United
States has two effective weapons: (1) the vigorous enforcement
of the Sherman Act, and (2) the power which Congress possesses
to investigate and make public the hidden dealings of
cartel interests.

It is significant that in Great Britain increasing interest in
the purposes and activities of cartels is being manifested--principally
as the result of American antitrust investigations which
have revealed that British industry, no less than our own industry,
has suffered the burden of restrictive practices imposed by
cartel arrangements.

Moreover, there has been developing in Canada a substantial
interest in the cartel problem. Thus, the <i>Ottawa Journal</i> recently
stated editorially that "it is fairly clear to all that cartels,
large combinations of industries parcelling out territories among
themselves, controlling patents and fixing prices, may be a
menace to the general well-being, and what is more vital, a
menace to world peace."

And the <i>Winnipeg Free Press</i> declared not long ago that
"it is gradually dawning upon Britain that rationalization of
industry has its dangers. They are discovering that monopolies
can and do develop evil practices.... Thus there is arising there
[in Great Britain] a demand for control of monopolies, the
breaking down of cartels and the restoration of competition between
the great industrial giants." After pointing out some of
the evils that flow from monopoly control, <i>Winnipeg Free
Press</i> went on to say: "National monopolies which restrain trade
are bad enough of themselves. But when combined with international
cartels they are intolerable. The Canadian government
should pay particular attention to the antitrust proceedings
in the United States. They reveal a most unhealthy state
of industrial health and if the economy of this country is to be
saved from disaster steps will have to be taken to break up the
evil monopolies and their cartels."

It would certainly be in the mutual interest of Great Britain
and ourselves if we could take a joint stand against private restrictive
arrangements in the postwar world and together seek
to stamp them out.

There is ample reason to believe that American exposure of
secret cartel practices may have its effect on the public policy
of other countries and promote common understanding that
certain types of activity should be outlawed in other countries
as well as here. But irrespective of the extent to which other
governments adopt policies similar to ours, there can be no
doubt that American business can thrive in competition with
foreign cartels if it does not enter into cartel restrictions. If
freed of cartel shackles, American enterprise should well be
able to expand in world markets and render foreign cartel control
ineffective. It is doubtful, indeed, whether any major international
cartel can effectively control world markets without
the participation and cooperation of the American segments of
the industry. There is a real question whether foreign cartels
can long survive in many industries if American cooperation is
not extended to them.

If and when some measure of control and regulation becomes
economically necessary on an international scale in a particular
industry, a question is presented for governmental action--not
for private cartel action. If, for example, in a particular industry
it seems necessary to control production in order to avoid
waste of a scarce natural resource, the solution of such a problem
is properly a responsibility of national or international governmental
action. Where control is needed, it must be by public
authority. If international restrictive agreements are ever needed,
they must be determined upon by governments--not by
private cartels.

But the situation where control would be required on an international
scale is decidedly the exception. Most foreign trade
in the postwar world can be conducted on a competitive basis
if we give competition a chance. The period following the war
will present an unprecedented challenge to the ingenuity of
mankind. Men of brains and imagination should have a chance
to rebuild the world, to take risks, to engage in foreign trade
and to win in competitive struggle, unhampered by private decrees.
The world is not a private hunting preserve which can be
divided at will among monopolists who think they have gained
squatters' rights.

<i>Technology</i>


In the days of Adam Smith it was possible to measure the
wealth of nations in terms of mineral resources, possession of
fertile lands and control of strategic geographical areas. Today
we have a new index to the wealth and security of nations.
Technology and applied science have become principal instruments
in the maintenance of a high standard of living and for
the protection of national interests. In fact, when we speak of
the balance of power in the modern world, we must take into
account the extent and quality of industrial and technological
resources as a dominant factor in national welfare. The horizons
which have been opened by applied science and research offer
to the world, and to our own nation in particular, new industries,
greater opportunities for our youth, higher levels of health and
comfort, and the attainment of that genuine social security which
comes with all great advancements in human knowledge.

Technology--its direction, its applications, and its enjoyment--is
today a primary concern of government. In a system
based upon freedom of enterprise, access to technology is the
fundamental condition of rapid advancement toward the goals
for which our nation is striving. The power that goes with the
development of modern technology has been perverted in totalitarian
countries to provide instruments of aggression. Because
totalitarian states have regimented science and have made
it subservient to imperial ambitions, it has been used to destroy
rather than to create. One of the principal problems which
the United Nations will encounter in the peace to come will be
the prevention of any abuse of new discoveries for the purpose
of establishing war machines which can threaten the peace of
the world.

The control of vital areas of research by monopolistic interests
is a condition which cannot be tolerated. Monopoly control
seeks to protect vested interests and to perpetuate its grip on
the advancement of science and technology. It retards the introduction
of new goods and services and the maintenance of
full employment in time of peace. Our experiences in this war
have demonstrated conclusively that monopolistic control of
critical sectors of industrial research has a paralyzing effect on
mobilization of our national strength. One of the most difficult
problems we have encountered in arming this country has been
the domination and restriction of technology by small privileged
groups. It has required strenuous efforts on the part of government
and industry alike to overcome the stifling effects of complacent
monopoly.

With rare exceptions industrial research at the present time
can only be carried on by large numbers of scientists and technicians
combining their ingenuity to resolve the complex problems
of both pure and applied science. In the last fifty years
technology has moved at such a rapid pace that no longer is
the small businessman in a position to maintain laboratories of
sufficient size. Today we witness the gigantic research organizations
of all major corporations, and no one desires to impair
their efficiency.

There is, nevertheless, a gap between the promise of organized
research conducted on a huge scale by great corporations
and the fulfillment as measured by accomplishments for the
public interest. So that there shall be no misunderstanding, I
should like to pay tribute to the vast army of scientists and
research workers who have done such remarkable work in the
years of peace as well as in the years of war in bringing forth a
multitude of amazing discoveries. It is not their fault that their
contributions have not been fully realized. The trouble is that
in many instances the misuse of research by monopolistic and
cartelized groups has resulted in the restricting of production,
withholding new products, and fencing in and blocking off new
developments.

One of the ablest and clearest statements of the effect of restrictive
arrangements upon research was made by Dr. F. B.
Jewett, vice-president of the American Telephone & Telegraph,
and chief of Bell Laboratories. In discussing an agreement between
his company and other parties, he stated:

"Broadly speaking, the practical effect of the agreement is
to limit the field of possible development of each party to its
present major activities....

"Thus, while a casual reading of the agreement by one not
thoroughly conversant with all the factors may appear to establish
the basis for an enlarged free development in most of
the fields, this is not actually the case.

<tb>

"The far-reaching effect of the proposed agreement on the
character and scope of our research and development work is
apparent. Viewed both from the standpoint of the research
worker in our laboratories and from the standpoint of those
responsible for the expenditures incurred by the Laboratories,
the inevitable result would be a narrowing of the field of activity
and failure to undertake anything which at the outset is not
clearly directed to the field of our current business. From the
standpoint of the man who has a brilliant idea which in its first
nebulous form seems to be applicable outside our business, there
will be little or no urge to go ahead in the face of a situation
where he knows that the results of his work have been sold in
advance outside of the Bell System. From the standpoint of
management there will likewise be no incentive, but quite the
reverse, to urging him on and appropriating money for his investigations."

A member of a monopoly or cartel group all too often finds
itself in a position where it must choose between the national
interest on the one hand and its cartel obligations on the other.
This difficulty is accurately stated in a document taken from
the Standard Oil Co. (N. J.) files with reference to the development
of 100 octane gasoline, one of the most vital materials
of modern warfare:

"This possibility is, of course, extremely attractive to the
Army Air Corps, but there is one difficulty involved which Mr.
Russell quite frankly discussed. The hydrogenation development
originated in Germany, and through cooperation all
around has now passed into the hands of the oil industry of the
entire world, and, to a certain extent, into the hands of the foreign
chemical industry as well. There is a full and free exchange
of technical information between all of the companies
and units involved in the hydrogenation development and this
exchange is not only by means of reports but by constant visits
of technical men. To cut off these reports and shut our hydrogenation
plants against these visitors would be not only a violation
of these agreements, which would involve us in many difficulties,
but would also be tantamount to a confession that we
were engaged in some work of special military value which
would mean that the plants would become a focal point for espionage.
The costs and difficulties of protecting against leakage
of information about large commercial operations under such
conditions is hard to estimate. <i>It seems that the only practical
way to handle this problem is to avoid carrying out the operation
of producing 100 octane number aviation gasoline commercially
as long as possible.</i> We would, of course, also have
to breach our agreements to render full and complete technical
reports to all of the companies associated with us (even to the
American companies, for fear of leakage). We should also forfeit
the advantage in producing at the least cost the best available
gasoline for commercial purposes.

"<i>Any program by which the Army Air Corps can obtain their
objective of a one or two year start over the rest of the world
on this vital matter bristles with difficulties and sacrifices from
our standpoint.</i> We will not have to cross the bridge finally until
our present experiments are completed. When and if we are
able to demonstrate that the hydrogenation plants are capable
of turning out an aviation product which with the usual quantity
of lead can be brought up to 100 octane number, we shall be
faced with the situation mentioned above. <i>To meet the very
proper desires of the Air Corps as expressed to us we shall have
to violate our agreements and perhaps forfeit the confidence of
our associates, both American and foreign, and beyond this we
shall either have to avoid any commercial use of the new method
or run the very grave risk of finding that our efforts at
secrecy have been abortive.</i>"

In pointing out the inevitable conflicts between national loyalties
and business interests which arise when industry is carried
on through private international cartel agreements, I do not attack,
nor do I intend to cast inferences against, the patriotic motives
of any men or companies. I assume that the persons who
have taken part in these transactions have not consciously acted
against the best interests of their country. But it is the cartel
system that is at fault. The individuals caught up in the system
are faced with a dilemma because it imposes on them choices
which it is almost impossible to make without violation of an
obligation to one of two conflicting interests.

One of the most serious limitations upon research has been
the division of fields of technology by cartel groups. If a company
is barred by agreement from an aspect of technology, there
is little if any incentive to do research in that field. One possible
consequence of such division of technology is that it permits
foreign interests to exercise influence amounting to domination
over research in this country.

No one doubts that synthetic rubber is a matter of national
interest. The cartel arrangement between Standard Oil Co.
(N. J.) and I. G. Farbenindustrie was such that the latter dominated
the development of synthetic rubber in this country as
well as in Germany.

In the case of the Bausch & Lomb (Rochester)-Carl Zeiss
(Jena, Germany) cartel on military optical glass, the heads of
the Bausch & Lomb department responsible for military research
were to be appointed only with the agreement of the
Zeiss firm.

In regard to the cartel involving Plexiglass, probably one of
the most important plastics, and one which has innumerable
military uses, the Rohm & Haas Company (Philadelphia)
stated: "We could think of a price agreement on the finished
product, or a division of our interests ... we have not only our
own interests at stake, but also the ones of our German house
[Rohm & Haas of Darmstadt, Germany] and the I. G."

In December 1934 a high official of the duPont Company
wrote to E. W. Webb, president of the Ethyl Gasoline Corporation
(copies were sent to every member of its Board of Directors)
as follows:

"I learned through our Organic Chemicals Division today
that the Ethyl Gasoline Corporation has in mind forming a
German company with the I. G. to manufacture Ethyl lead in
that country.

"I have just had two weeks in Washington, no inconsiderable
part of which was devoted to criticising the interchanging with
foreign companies of chemical knowledge which might have a
military value. Such giving of information by an industrial
company might have the gravest repercussions on it. The Ethyl
Gasoline Corporation would be no exception, in fact, would
probably be singled out for special attack because of the ownership
of its stock.

"It would seem, on the face of it, that the quantity of Ethyl
lead used for commercial purposes in Germany would be too
small to go after. It has been claimed that Germany is secretly
arming. Ethyl lead would doubtless be a valuable aid to military
aeroplanes.

"I am writing you this to say that in my opinion under no
conditions should you or the Board of Directors of the Ethyl
Gasoline Corporation disclose any secrets or 'know how' in
connection with the manufacture of tetra-ethyl lead to Germany."

Yet, in the face of this warning from duPont, on January 12,
1935, Webb wrote the Chief of the Army Air Corps that "There
is no technical data of military importance known to us which
would be involved in the building of such a plant that has not
already received wide publicity, or is of common knowledge in
the aviation field."

This statement strikingly ignores the warning received from
duPont only one month earlier that such a disclosure would
"doubtless" be prejudicial to our national security. In this connection
it should not be overlooked that duPont and Dow were
the sole producers of the chemical components of tetraethyl lead
and, as such, were the concerns which alone possessed the essential
know-how.

Why did Ethyl Gasoline disregard duPont's warning? Webb
himself has supplied the answer in the final paragraph of his
letter of January 12, 1935:

"There is, furthermore, an equally, if not more, important
business aspect to the German situation. We are owned by
Standard Oil and General Motors in equal shares. General
Motors has important investments in Germany, producing there
in excess of 50 percent of the motor cars. Standard Oil has large
investments in all phases of the petroleum business in Germany....
We feel ... for the reasons specifically mentioned
here, that it would be extremely unfortunate for all concerned
if we do not proceed to carry out the agreement with I. G....
A refusal or undue delay on our part ... might bring on
some serious reprisal measures."

This leaves nothing for surmise. It is not unfair to conclude,
in view of these facts, that for the directors of Ethyl Gasoline
the preservation of I. G. good-will conflicted with the maintenance
of good faith in dealings with their own government.
Though duPont, from the beginning, was opposed to the entire
deal on grounds of patriotic scruples, nevertheless it eventually
deferred. In an inter-office memo of the duPont Company
appears the following:

"I think we should tell I.C.I. that the technical and engineering
information which we are giving I. G. in connection
with Tetraethyl Lead is being given them entirely at the request
of the Ethyl Gasoline Corporation. As they no doubt know,
Ethyl Gas and I. G. set up some arrangements whereby they
are going to participate jointly in the manufacture and sale of
Ethyl Lead in Germany and we are turning over our information
to Ethyl Gas which they in turn can submit to I. G. as part
of the bargain in connection with this joint enterprise."

The full extent of the dilemma in which cartel members are
placed by the conflict of their cartel commitments with national
interest is indicated in two statements made by a representative
of one of the world's great industrial combines. In a letter written
in 1939, after the outbreak of war, a Standard Oil official
stated:

"Pursuant to these arrangements I was able to keep my appointments
in Holland, where I had three days of discussion
with the representatives of the I. G. They delivered to me
assignments of some 2,000 foreign patents and <i>we did our best
to work out complete plans for a modus vivendi which would
operate through the term of the war, whether or not the U. S.
came in</i>. All of the arrangements could not be completed, but
it is hoped that enough has been done to permit closing the most
important uncompleted points by cable. It is difficult to visualize
as yet just how successful we shall be in maintaining our
relations through this period without personal contacts."

It is of significance also that this same representative of a
cartel group brilliantly expressed the cartel point of view when
he said:

"Upon completion of that agreement, the war intervened
because our grouping of interested parties included Americans,
British, Dutch, Germans, and the war introduced quite a number
of complications. <i>How we are going to make these belligerent
parties lie down in the same bed isn't quite clear as yet.</i> We
are now addressing ourselves to that phase of the problem and
I hope we will find some solution. <i>Technology has to carry on--war
or no war</i>--so we must find some solution to these last
problems."

It is in their very nature that cartels restrict the fullest developments
of new products and that they attempt to place rigid
handicaps on output. Very often they even adulterate the
quality of products in order to exact the greatest possible toll
from the public. Several examples may be used to indicate the
practices and mental attitude of monopoly groups in relation to
the quality of material. The following quotation concerning
flashlight bulbs speaks for itself:

"Two or three years ago we proposed a reduction in the life
of flashlight lamps from the old basis on which one lamp was
supposed to outlast three batteries, to a point where the life of
the lamp and the life of the battery under service conditions
would be approximately equal. Sometime ago, the battery
manufacturers went part way with us on this and accepted lamps
of two battery lives instead of three. This has worked out very
satisfactorily.

"We have been continuing our studies and efforts to bring
about the use of one battery life lamps. I think you will be
interested in the attached analysis which Messrs. Prideaux and
Egeler have worked up covering the various points involved
in going to the one battery life basis. If this were done, we
estimate that it would result in increasing our flashlight business
approximately 60 per cent. We can see no logical reason either
from our standpoint or that of the battery manufacturer why
such a change should not be made at this time.

"Messrs. Parker and Johnson now have this matter up with
the battery manufacturers and I would urge that every assistance
be given them to put it over."

Methyl methacrylate, the name of one of the best known
plastics, is used not only in the industrial field to make airplane
windshielding and many other structural materials, but it also
has excellent qualities for the making of dental plates or dentures.
As a result of the monopoly control of this material by
the duPont Company and Rohm & Haas, its uses were divided
into two fields: industrial and dental. At the time these firms
were indicted a sharp difference in price was maintained. When
methyl methacrylate was sold for industrial purposes, it cost 85
cents a pound, while the price to dental users was $45 a pound.
The dental profession soon learned that there was no difference
in the material, whether it was designed for industrial or dental
use. As a result they began to purchase their requirements
from industrial users, in order to gain the advantage of the
cheaper industrial price which, we could assume, might possibly
be passed on to the dental patient.

The monopoly clique considered this a form of bootlegging.
On March 15, 1940, the Vernon-Benshoff Company (Pittsburgh),
a member of the clique, made various suggestions to
the Rohm and Haas Company which, although they were not
placed in actual effect, offer valuable insight into the shocking
extremes to which monopolists will consider going:

"Our discussion of the Pure Food and Drug Law and pulling
the acrylic denture under it leads me to wonder if the manufacturers
of the commercial molding powders might not add an
ingredient which would not effect the molding properties, but
which would disqualify it under the act. Apparently a slight
trace would suffice. Naturally it would be omitted from the
strictly denture powder.

"Recently I asked Dr. Johnson to suggest an addition which
might interfere with distillation of monomer or retard polymerization.
He could not think of anything that wouldn't spoil
the molding properties or clarity of the powders. But there the
quantity needed to accomplish the result was the handicap.

"Under the very finicky regulations of the above act however,
it may be the slightest trace of the right agent, too little
to constitute harm to molding (or health either as a matter of
fact) would suffice to have bootleg products in bad.

"A millionth of one per cent of arsenic or lead might cause
them to confiscate every bootleg unit in the country. There
ought to be a trace of something that would make them rear
up."

In its reply the Rohm & Haas Company said that it was in
agreement with the general principles presented in the letter
quoted above and that it would ask its research department to
work on the matter. This was expressed in a letter of March
21, 1940 to the Vernon-Benshoff firm:

"With reference to your letter of March 15th, we shall be
glad to investigate whether denture materials come under the
Pure Food and Drug Act. We agree with you that if we could
put some ingredient in our commercial molding material which
would disqualify it under the Pure Food and Drug Act, this
would be a very fine method of controlling the bootleg situation.
We shall take this matter up with our development department
and advise you whether any such material could be
used."

A striking way in which research can be perverted is illustrated
by another example. The dyestuffs industry is one which
is basically monopolistic and cartelized. A tight grip is maintained
over its price structure. This is especially true of dyestuffs
for textiles. Recently the duPont Company's research
laboratories developed a pigment which can be utilized either
in paints or as a dye for textiles. The duPont research laboratories
considered various ways to be sure that the pigment could
be limited in use to the paint and finishing field so as not to
disturb the price structure of the textile dyestuffs field. The
trend of duPont's research thought on this subject was stated
by the director of one of its laboratories:

"Further work may be necessary on adding contaminants to
'Monastral' colors to make them unsatisfactory on textiles but
satisfactory for paints."

After working on this problem for some time, duPont's Jackson
Laboratory reported on its progress somewhat dolefully.
(DuPont says of Jackson Laboratory that it is "one of the
largest organic chemical research laboratories in the world.")
The particular task involved was difficult, according to a report
by the Jackson Laboratory dated June 26, 1940:

"Mr. Chantler was of the opinion that pigment mixtures,
unsuitable for textile printing would be very difficult to obtain.

"(B) <i>Agents Injurious to Textile Printing.</i>--The suggestion
was made that certain compounds that were white under ordinary
conditions but that would be oxidized to give colored bodies
when the prints are subjected to chlorine bleach, could be
used. A few experiments had been made along this line using
such compounds as Chlorostain N, dianisidine and DuPont Oxy
Black Base. Complete data on this work are not available. Mr.
Dahlen expressed the opinion that the addition of such compounds
probably would cause as much or more damage to the
paint trade as to textile printing.

"Such substances as ground glass and carborundum were suggested
for incorporation with the pigment. While these materials
would undoubtedly scratch printing rolls, there is considerable
doubt as to their effect in paints and lacquers."

Two days later the problem was again attacked at a meeting
between the representatives of General Aniline Works and the
duPont Company. Eight possible methods of adulteration
were considered. I quote a few from the confidential memorandum
of their discussion:

"1. A new type of copper phthalocyanine (CPC) for the
paint and lacquer trade which would be unsuitable for application
textiles.

<tb>

"The importance of solving these problems was recognized,
and it was agreed that both parties would work on promising
ideas which resulted from this discussion. The three problems
are closely related, and it is possible that the solution of one or
two will automatically solve the third. It was agreed that a
powder would be the preferable standard. After detailed discussion
of various modes of attack, the following appeared to
be outstanding:

"1. (a) Mixtures of CPC with Lakes.--The most promising
mode of attack appears to lie in the formulation of a mixture
of CPC with a lake, especially a lake of CPC. Such a mixture
should have fairly good fastness to light and <i>yet be poor in wash
fastness on textiles</i> or incompatible with the usual textile printing
lacquers....

<tb>

"(d) Deteriorate Cotton.--Compounds might be incorporated
into CPC which when applied to textiles and followed by
bleaching or heating treatment <i>might increase the deterioration
of the cloth</i>. Compounds such as chlorates or aliphatic halides
which would produce hydrochloric acid were specific examples.

<tb>

"(g) Irritating Substances.--<i>It is known that certain resins
and solvents are irritating to the skin, often causing dermatitis.
It might be possible to formulate a CPC composition which will
make textile materials irritating to the skin.</i>

"(h) Incorporation of Grit.--It seemed too dangerous to
attempt to add gritty material to CPC since, although it would
interfere with the use of the material for textiles, it would also
offer serious disadvantages in grinding on application of surface
coatings.

"It was agreed that the mere dulling of the material would
not be a satisfactory solution since dull shades are often used in
the textile trade. Most of the above comments are often based
on work on blue, and many of the solutions would apply equally
well to the green. In fact it is believed that there is a larger
market for the sale of green than the blue."

It seems to me that we cannot afford to place our sole reliance
upon monopolistic corporations whose interests have only
too often been divided, who have sought restricted production
rather than full employment of our resources and labor, and
who have sought for monopoly control rather than public welfare.
We must learn by the bitter lessons of the early years of
this war which found us lacking both materials and the know-how
to make them, resulting from the restrictive practices of
monopolies which instinctively seek to produce as little as possible
for the greatest profit.

In war and peace alike technology is a vital factor in our
national life. The present war is being waged with weapons
and equipment which represent the last word in scientific development.
Careful planning and rigorous adherence to the plans
enabled Germany to have, in 1939, the most efficient war machine
the world had ever seen. Now, after several years of
feverish activity, the United Nations have at last caught up with
and passed Germany in the race for armament superiority.

Now that our war effort has finally been put in high gear an
entirely different kind of problem seems to be emerging. Under
the forced draft of war urgency and unlimited government expenditure,
materials and products are being made the like of
which we have not heretofore known. The light metals, aluminum
and magnesium, the wonder metal beryllium, the miraculously
efficient diamond tools and the tungsten carbide tools, the
plastics and dozens of other new developments will unquestionably
make the postwar world something entirely different from
that to which we have been accustomed. Many of the processes
which can revolutionize our mode of living are owned by the
government. Some are in the custody of the Alien Property
Custodian. Others have been developed with federal funds,
either by government agencies or by private concerns. No one
will seriously dispute the wisdom of retaining control of these
government-owned processes and of fostering the fullest possible
use of them for the benefit of all.

There can be no denying that the war has resulted in a concentration
of productive facilities in the hands of a relatively
small number of gigantic corporations. Even before Pearl Harbor
some of them were enormous concerns capable of wielding
irresistible power in the competitive struggle with other, smaller
companies. Today and after the war the smaller competitors
which have survived will find the odds against them a great deal
more disheartening than before. It is not in the public interest
to allow the small competitors to be killed off in the uneven
fight. Neither is it in the public interest to place hampering
restrictions upon the effects of the large companies to fully utilize
their research laboratories and technical experience for the
purpose of strengthening their competitive position.

Without doubt the sensible thing for us to do is to make research
and technology available to the little fellow as well as to
his big competitor. In agriculture this policy has amply demonstrated
its soundness. Experiment stations financed by state and
federal funds extend the benefits of their research to the
small farmer as well as to the large. It is doubtful that one
could find a single intelligent farm operator, large or small, who
would voice the opinion that governmentally financed agricultural
research has not been worth many times the money spent
for it. The small industrialist has the same right to expect that
a government wishing him to continue to make his contribution
to the national welfare shall offer him those benefits of research
and expert advice which he cannot afford to provide for himself
but which can easily be provided by the government.

There are those who scoff at all mention of cartels and refer
to them as bogies conjured up to justify an attack on all big
business. Such an attitude is dangerous. Cartels present the
greatest challenge to our system of free enterprise.

In every cartel arrangement which has come to the attention
of the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice technology
has been a vital factor. It is the responsibility of government
to see that technology remains free from artificial
control and monopoly perversion.

Every instance of this sort is evidence of the possibility of
service to the public which might be expected if the government
should see fit to provide itself with an adequately financed and
numerically sufficient staff of technologists. It is my belief that
the time has arrived for the adoption of legislation which will
adequately protect and advance the public interest in technological
development.

<i>Patents</i>


The importance and the position of patents in the American
economy have been sharply defined since the outbreak of the
present war. While the problem which patents have presented
to our economy did not begin with the attack on Pearl Harbor,
our experience within the past few years has crystallized many
of the questions and issues at stake.

Patents are fundamental factors in the cartel problem because
patent agreements are quite frequently used as the basis of cartel
arrangements. The vital importance of control over technology
and research to the achievement of cartel power enhances the
significance of patents as the foundation stones of cartel structures.
At the same time, the effects of patent abuses upon the
economy are magnified to a critical degree.

We are all familiar with the historical background of the
patent system and with the intent of the authors of the Constitution
in stating that Congress shall have the power to promote
the progress of science and useful arts by the grant of a patent.
It is no accident that the original clause in the Constitution was
phrased in careful terms. The framers of the Constitution inherited
a concern toward the grant of any monopoly by government.
They were specific in limiting the scope of the patent
monopoly because they did not wish the patent to become the
basis of a system of privilege.

When the American patent system was born, we were a frontier
nation. Pioneers in every branch of science had before them
an inviting horizon of discovery. The recognition of their contribution
towards the promotion of science and useful arts
served as a stimulus to their initiative and ingenuity. During
this period the patent system served our country well and acted
as a major incentive in the making of industrial America.

Our patent system was designed to "promote the progress
of science and useful arts." In many respects it has done so, and
has given proper protection to inventors and enterprising businessmen.
Where it operates to carry out this purpose, there can
be no just complaint. But in many instances the patent system
has been perverted to accomplish exactly the opposite effect.
The patent has become the principal power weapon of modern
monopoly, and the misuse of patents the major tactic of industrial
cartels. This perversion has become so widespread as to
jeopardize the whole patent system.

The patent problem as it exists today arises in an environment
vastly different from the handicraft era in which modern
industry found its beginnings. It is not the patent grant as such
nor is it the operation of the individual inventor that brings the
patent system into question. Invention today is a large-scale
industry in a complex economy. In many branches of industrial
production vast monopolies exercise a dominating influence over
research. It is the abuse and misuse of patents by such concentrated
groups wielding tremendous economic power which have
brought patents into conflict with the fundamental purpose of
the patent law and with the Sherman Act.

Monopoly interests, which have violated the antitrust laws in
the course of their abuse of patents, have made the claim that
the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice is endangering
the patent system by prosecuting restraints of trade based
on patents. Many honest and innocent bystanders have been
confused and misled by this propaganda. The fact of the matter
is that danger to the patent system arises not from enforcement
of the antitrust laws but from the flagrant abuses of those
who use patents as the foundation stone of illegal monopolistic
control of industry. If the patent system is finally wrecked we
shall have to thank those who brought it into disrepute by their
unflagging attempts to use the patent grant in a manner contrary
both to the law and to the national interest.

Because patents have become an instrument of power-hungry
and power-seeking groups in industry, grave doubt now exists
as to whether our economy can longer tolerate and permit the
control and consolidation of patents by industrial oligarchies.

Among the many serious abuses to which patents have become
subject within the last few decades, it is necessary only to
specify a few.

1. Patents have been used illegally to establish regimented
systems of industrial control by private groups.

2. Patents have been used, contrary to the tradition and intent
of the American economy, to stifle new enterprise, to limit
capacity and production, to divide world markets, to impose
artificial and arbitrary price levels, and to set up private tariff
walls.

3. In their determination to eliminate competition among
themselves and to prevent the emergence of new enterprise,
monopoly groups in industry have used patents as a shield for
conspiracy to violate the antitrust laws.

4. Employing the instruments of law designed to secure
justice and protection to the small inventor and small businessman,
monopoly interests have used litigation and threats of
litigation based on patents to compel the submission or surrender
of independent enterprise to the dictates of monopoly control.

5. Patents have been used by industrial giants here and
abroad to fasten their grip on international trade by setting up
patent cartel agreements which slice world markets into exclusive
trade areas. In many instances these international patent
cartels have made it plain that they consider adherence to
monopoly rules to be above and beyond the laws of the United
States and other countries.

6. Our experiences in the first World War and the present
global war have demonstrated conclusively that the interests of
hostile countries have been able to use patents as weapons in
economic warfare against the United States. By delaying the
development of strategic new industries, by withholding know-*how,
and by strangling the market with exorbitant prices for
critical materials, monopoly groups in aggressor nations have
sought to weaken the war potential of the American economy.

7. In numerous instances, scientific research has been perverted
and misused in order to strengthen monopoly restrictions
illegally based on patents.

In the scores of Department of Justice cases involving patents
and illegal agreements based on patents and in the testimony
before various congressional committees investigating the facts,
it has become overwhelmingly clear that if free enterprise is to
be maintained, patent abuses must be eliminated. At the same
time, the protection which the patent right was designed to give
to the independent inventor and businessman must be strengthened
and restored. If the system of economic competition on
which this nation depends for its well-being is to be preserved,
it is imperative that economic opportunity be granted to all on
equal terms. This cannot be accomplished if privileged groups
are able to obtain unfair advantage over new enterprise or to
amass huge patent structures which block the road to industrial
initiative.

In a whole roster of industries, patents have been employed
as the police power of private economic governments. Our industrial
history is replete with examples of industries dominated
by a few small monopoly groups whose power rested on
patents. In the radio industry, in explosives, in spectacles, in
glass containers, in magnesium, in vitamins, in medicines, in
building materials, in dyestuffs, in electrical equipment and
in synthetic rubber, to mention prominent examples, the development
of the industry has been decided by the arbitrary discretion
of groups controlling concentrated patent structures.
Using patents as an excuse, monopolists have sought to determine
who shall be given permission to manufacture, to buy and
to sell. They have determined what prices should be fixed and
in what markets sales might also be made. Illegally wielding
their patent power such groups have completely squelched free
enterprise in these and in many other industries. Such control
is regimentation and bureaucracy in an extreme and pernicious
form. The independent businessman who falls victim to this
system of control is without recourse.

Many businessmen seriously object to the regulation of industry
by government. What they do not realize is that it is
not public government but private government which exercises
the most rigid control over industrial conduct. Such regimentation
violates the fundamental and elementary principles of
economic liberty. If we believe in free enterprise, we cannot
at the same time tolerate the existence of private economic government
which bears no responsibility to the public. This type
of regimentation has acquired such influence in numerous
branches of industry that free enterprise no longer operates.

A striking example of the manner in which patents are misused
to create private industrial governments is afforded by the
glass container industry. For more than a generation this industry
has been dominated by a monopoly group whose main
function it has been to acquire and license patents. This private
governing body produced nothing itself, yet the production of
practically all the glass containers made in this country was subject
to its will. The amount of glass containers to be produced
by any manufacturer was closely regulated and limited. The
type of bottle he could make was determined by a system which
permitted practically no competition. Outsiders who attempted
to enter the industry were promptly eliminated by vigorous
and costly patent suits.

The patent policy of the monopoly group was neatly set
forth in a company memorandum which states:

"In taking out patents we have three main purposes: (a) To
cover the actual machines which we are putting out and prevent
duplication of them ... (b) to block the development of machines
which might be constructed by others for the same purpose
as our machines, using alternative means; (c) to secure
patents on possible improvements of competing machines so as
to 'fence in' those and prevent their reaching an improved
stage...."

In the administration and regulation of the glass container
industry, this group pursued a licensing policy equally intended
to perpetuate its monopolistic position. In a memorandum outlining
this aspect of its control, the following statement appears:

"Consequently, we adopted the policy which we have followed
ever since, of restricted licensing. That is to say, (a) We
licensed the machines only to selected manufacturers of the better
type, refusing many licenses whom we thought would be price
cutters, and (b) We restricted their fields of manufacture, in
each case, to certain specific articles, with the idea of preventing
too much competition. (c) In order to retain more complete
control of the situation, we retained title to the machines and simply
leased them for a definite period of years, usually 8 or 10
years, with the privilege of renewal of a smaller additional
term."

Obviously, the patent and licensing policy in the glass container
industry constitutes a system of oppressive regulation
which neither promotes the progress of science and the useful
arts nor permits the operation of competitive economic processes.
Yet, instances like the glass container industry could be multiplied
for it is by no means unique in modern American industry.

The restrictive effects of patent abuses on the production of
critical materials in this country became clearly apparent following
the outbreak of war. Shortage followed shortage, and in
nearly every instance the basic device restricting our expansion
of capacity and output was found to be a patent cartel agreement.

A dramatic illustration of a shortage resulting from a restrictive
patent agreement enforced by cartel groups is provided
in the case of tungsten carbide. Few items are as important as
machine tools to our economy both in peace and in war. The
best cutting edge for machine tools is made from tungsten carbide.
Because of a patent cartel agreement between the General
Electric Company of this country and the Krupp Works of
Germany, the price was maintained at such a high level that the
second largest manufacturer of this commodity said:

"The control of the tungsten carbide patents by the General
Electric Company and the Krupp Company has resulted in
keeping the prices at exorbitant levels. Now when the emergency
has come, industry has not learned how to use tungsten
carbide and has not the machines, the skilled men, or the technique
which it would have had if the material had been available
at the same low prices at which it was available to German
industries."

Before the patent cartel was organized, the price in the
United States was less than $50 a pound. After the cartel was
formed in 1928, the price of tungsten carbide rose to as high
as $453 a pound or, in other words, much more than the price
of gold. Significantly enough, the price in Germany never rose
above $50 a pound.

While we recognize that technology is the most dynamic
factor of change in the modern world, it is not sufficiently
realized that in the struggle to control technological development
and to confine research within their feudal domains, monopolistic
interests divide the universe of technology in exactly
the same way that they parcel out world territory. Using the
huge patent structures which they have amassed, industrial
giants divide among themselves the major branches of technology
and allow no one to encroach on their preserves.

Although we depend upon research as the principal source
of those advances which promise a better and a healthier world,
we tend to overlook the fact that the power which modern monopoly
wields over research, by virtue of patents, often perverts
the spirit of discovery. How the deliberate misdirection of research
is carried out is clearly indicated in at least three cases involving
electric lamps, plastics, and dyestuffs.

Electric lamps in the United States are practically the private
preserve of a domestic monopoly. The history of this industry
can be written in terms of the elimination of competition, based
largely on the abuse of patent litigation and price fixing. One
of the great threats to monopoly control can come from the
virility and imagination of our inventive genius. For this reason
the vested interests attempt not only to control their current
monopoly, but take every precaution to project their control
into the future and to guard against the development and exploitation
of inventions by outsiders.

One of the greatest developments in the lighting art since
Edison invented the incandescent lamp is fluorescent lighting.
It has already proven to be many times more efficient, and
cheaper, than incandescent lighting. The rapid development of
this newer type of lighting which would come from a competitive
situation has been carefully suppressed by the monopoly
group. Patent control by the monopoly group controlling incandescent
lamps has been the main instrument for the suppression
of fluorescent lighting. Not only the monopoly group governing
incandescent lighting, but the electric utility companies
as well, fear the effects of the widespread use of more efficient
means of lighting, since it would reduce their sale of electricity
and hence their profits. A letter from the manager of the lighting
bureau of a large power company to the General Electric
Company should be of interest to the public:

"Increasingly I seem to become the 'father confessor' on
fluorescent lighting as far as the utility men are concerned. This
concerns one of the displays dealing with fluorescent lighting in
your G. E. building at the New York World's Fair. I must
confess that although I have been in your exhibit twice I did
not see this particular display.

"It appears that 20 watts of fluorescent lighting are compared
with 20 watts of incandescent lighting, the sign purporting to
read something to the effect 'See the difference between equal
wattages of fluorescent and mazda lighting.' Of course, the
readings on the foot candle meters show dramatic differences.

"If this demonstration is as explained to us, I think it does
<i>violate the spirit of the understanding that our group had in
Cleveland. As a matter of fact, I would think it violated the
fundamental concept of the lamp department that advances in
the lighting art should not be at the expense of wattage</i>, but
should give the customer more for the same money. I hope you
can find a way to change this exhibit, so that it does not give
misleading impressions to the crowd who will see it."

Here is the reply by the General Electric Company:

"When Miss Winters showed me the attached letter ... I
immediately got in touch with Al Reas with regard to the demonstration
at the fair. Apparently this particular demonstration
was temporarily loaned for use at the fair, and is now being
returned to the exhibit shop. <i>Therefore, by removing this particular
exhibit, Sharp and the other utility men need have nothing
to worry about.</i>"

Even if such flagrant misuse of patents did not occur, the
grip on our economic life which monopoly holds through patents
would be a threat to our system of enterprise. The spirit
and substance of free enterprise cannot exist in an environment
where an independent businessman with an independent idea, or
an inventor with a new discovery in a monopoly-ridden field,
finds himself compelled either to submit to monopoly control
or to be barred from the market. It is ironical but true that
while a patent is supposed to give protection and encouragement
to the inventor, possession of a patent today is little more than
an invitation to predatory litigation. The threat of expensive
and protracted patent litigation is perhaps the most effective
means by which monopoly enforces its private rule on industry
to eliminate competition.

The small businessman facing such obstacles has limited
choices of action. He can sue the large group, or risk suit, but
in either event will find himself involved in a costly, lengthy
process. He generally emerges with a broken spirit and a petition
in bankruptcy.

The files of the Department of Justice are crowded with
complaints and pleadings of these little men. They have found
these handicaps insuperable in their attempts to compete. In
giving testimony before the Temporary National Economic
Committee, one small manufacturer in the glass container industry
recited a tale which is frequently and tragically repeated
throughout many branches of production. This particular witness,
sued for infringement on nine or ten counts, stated:

"We naturally were finally forced to hire a patent attorney.
We had to acquire the services of a Texas attorney, and I think
there are some two or three patent attorneys in the State. They
brought us into court in April of 1935, as I recall. Well, when
I arrived in San Angelo and met them there in the hotel, I can
conservatively say there was a half train load of attorneys and
equipment. There were motion picture projectors and attorneys
all over the place. I don't know anyone of the Hartford legal
staff that was not there. They were prepared to give us a nice
battle. Well, I had only one attorney and he was considerably
lost in that crowd. I wish you might have seen his face that
morning. So I promptly asked for a recess until the afternoon
in order to see if we couldn't settle the case out of court."

As the witness testified at the time, the "settlement" was "a
sort of slow death arrangement."

This situation has become a common condition, but it is not
new. Thomas Edison once stated that patent litigation cost
him more than he ever made from an invention. Unfortunately,
the government has not as yet developed any procedure to protect
the legitimate rights which a patent is supposed to confer
on the little man. I have hopes that this aspect of the problem
will be considered and met in the not too distant future.

Even if every other charge of malpractice or problem of monopolistic
abuse of patents were ignored, there would remain a
crucial question. Technology is an index of national security,
and technological strength depends upon technological freedom.
Yet, in two world wars we have learned that the infiltration of
American industry by foreign and hostile interests has been
conducted through patents and patent agreements.

In 1914, we experienced severe and crippling scarcities of
dyestuffs and medicines, because patents held by German interests
had prevented the development of American production.
In the case of salvarsan, Ehrlich's "magic bullet" for the cure
of syphilis, we found that a patent protected the product, but
did not reveal the method of its manufacture. The same situation
occurred in other drugs, such as veronal and novocaine, and
in other fields, such as metal alloys and special electrical equipment.

Since the outbreak of the present war, our vulnerability to
this method of attack has been revealed once more. The use
of patents as the spearheads of attack in industrial and economic
warfare, intended to weaken our war potential, is illustrated in
the beryllium industry, in synthetic rubber, in pharmaceuticals,
in optical goods, and in other important military and civilian
supplies. It is clear that abuses of this nature, having consequences
which affect both our national security and our standards
of living, cannot be tolerated.

Whether at the hands of domestic or foreign interests, misuse
of the patent system and abuses of patent power militate against
the best interest of the American people. It is our task and our
responsibility to uproot these malpractices. Within the space of
four years the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice
has brought more than forty cases involving these typical
abuses, and this Division is investigating many more.

I should like it clearly understood that I believe the patent
system in many respects has served this country well. As long
as it stays within its proper orbit it can continue as a great force
in the industrial and scientific development of our country. Indeed,
it must be one of our aims to strengthen the patent system
to make it more effective for the protection of small business
and for the encouragement of new invention. Those who
have a deep belief in the patent system should support the government's
action in uprooting and eliminating the abuses which
have done so much to discredit the patent system generally.

The vigorous enforcement of the antitrust laws is, of course,
our greatest guarantee that democratic opportunity will be kept
alive in our economic system. Something more is needed, however,
to make certain that free enterprise has a fighting chance.
In this connection, it is encouraging to note that the Senate has
had under consideration legislation intended to provide access
to technology to government and public alike. It is, of course,
absolutely necessary that in the present stage of technological
development, where the military security of the nation may depend
upon the quality of its technology, that the government
have every facility at its disposal to keep abreast of technological
change. From the standpoint of economic health, however,
means must be found of granting to the small businessman or
the small inventor, who cannot hope to compete on an equal
footing with the massive strength and enormous resources of
great industrial laboratories, a chance to initiate and develop
new ideas, new processes and new products.

In numerous instances patents have been used to discourage
research by independent inventors and businessmen. What incentive
is there to inventors to develop new products or processes
when they may be, in effect, inventing themselves into a
patent infringement suit? Very often in such cases the fact of
infringement is never determined. We all know that patent litigation
is costly and time consuming. In disputes between monopoly
groups and smaller opponents the difference in economic
strength between the two parties is usually the determining factor.
In this situation small competitors often find it less expensive
to depend upon the research and the largesse of great
corporations, by accepting licenses which are usually restrictive.
Under such conditions neither the opportunity nor the fact of
free enterprise can flourish.

Conduct of research by government does not mean that it
would enter into competition with industry. Rather, research
sponsored and carried on with the facilities and support of the
government would constitute a strong stimulus to private initiative.

The government would enter no business as a result of carrying
on research. It would sell nothing, and it would not prevent
others from going into business. The fruits of discoveries
produced by government research would be open to all. It is
primarily those interests which seek to deny access to technology
by independent enterprise that are opposed to the entry of government
into this field.

The great need of small business in the post-war world for
new opportunities and new directions cannot be fulfilled if the
small businessman is denied access to technology. If the government
provided the scientific and technical resources which
placed small enterprise on an equal footing with great corporations,
we should undoubtedly witness a revival of the spirit of
industrial adventure.

Ultimately, the entire public as consumers would receive the
benefits of a government research program. When competition
is absent and research is dominated by monopoly groups, the
consumer not only pays higher prices for what he does get, but
has no assurance that he is obtaining the best possible products.
Monopoly has no incentive to progress, and so long as it is able
to control research it need not strive to make better products at
lower prices.

In addition to meeting the needs of small business and consumers,
the maintenance of scientific research by an over-all
public agency is a direct concern of government. The importance
of technology to national welfare has been shown strikingly
during the present war. There are many areas of scientific
research and development which private industry cannot adequately
explore and develop. There are many branches of science
and technology, as well as of industrial development,
where government cannot afford to be dependent upon the
efforts of private monopoly groups. The lists of shortages
which hampered our war effort in early days of the present
struggle resulted in nearly every instance from restrictive effects
of monopoly control. Government was forced to turn to
monopoly groups which dominated the market. It is essential
for the future that the hazard of dependence on monopoly be
removed.

Industry itself, large as well as small, would profit tremendously
if research conducted by the government supplemented
private efforts and increased our stock of scientific knowledge.
The creation of new industries would open up new channels for
private investment and would help to eliminate the periodic
effects of depression. The constant flow of new ideas into industry
is essential if we wish to have both full production and full
employment. Government research could become one of the
principal means of stimulating and encouraging new industry
and at the same time overcoming the effects of the business
cycle.

The means of correcting patent abuses and of renewing competitive
opportunity in industry are available in existing law
and with relatively minor modifications in the scope of governmental
authority. Unless we are willing to accept private industrial
government as a substitute for a free economy, it must
be our determination that the spirit and purpose of the patent
laws and the conditions necessary to competition shall be securely
established. If we would avoid the destruction of the
patent system as the consequence of its abuse, it must be made
clear to monopoly groups and industry that they cannot base
their restrictive practices and policies on patent privileges.

<i>Medicines</i>


In a very real sense the producers and distributors of medical
products occupy a position of public responsibility. On the
whole, those in the drug industry who are charged with this
responsibility have carried out their obligations in a highly
praiseworthy manner. They are to be commended and congratulated.

In nearly every instance in which the standards of service
and of public welfare have not been maintained we find that
monopoly groups have been responsible for the abuse of public
confidence. When monopoly is able to impose restrictive conditions
on the production, the price and the distribution of vital
medicines and to determine who may buy and sell products, it
is in the interests of the drug industry and the public alike
for government to intervene.

Thus when it was found that a small ring of producers had
been able to maintain fixed prices on insulin and to pick and
choose those who would be allowed to distribute insulin to the
public, it was necessary for the government to act.

There are approximately two million persons in the United
States suffering from diabetes. Most of these sufferers require
one or more daily injections of insulin. They are dependent for
their very lives on an adequate supply of the drug at a reasonable
price. Yet a monopoly group exploiting its privileged position
took advantage of the industry and of the public to impose
arbitrary prices and unreasonable conditions of distribution.
Wholesalers, distributors, and retailers were compelled to adhere
to the edicts of the monopoly group under the threat that
if they did not do so, no insulin would be sold to them.

The possible consequences of this exercise of monopoly power
on the well-being of victims of diabetes are appalling, yet in
the hands of monopoly the needs of the public become subordinated
by the edicts which are imposed on the industry and the
public alike. It is for this reason that the industry itself, as well
as government, must continuously be vigilant to oppose the
growth and exercises of monopoly power and to stimulate
wholesome competition.

Few effects of monopoly have been more insidious than the
consequences of cartel control over many areas in the drug and
medical field.

Because of cartel and patent agreements which carve up world
markets and divide fields of production, American drug manufacturers
have in some cases been denied the right and the
chance to develop the American drug industry to its full possibilities.
Because international cartels have been able to set up
their own trade restrictions, American drug manufacturers have
been prevented from competing within the United States. In
many cases American manufacturers have been barred from engaging
in competition in other countries and from exporting to
such countries. In particular, American producers have found
themselves shut off from South American markets. Illegal patent
abuses and agreements have in other cases prohibited American
manufacturers from entering production or carrying on
research in many important fields dominated by foreign interests.

The fight against disease is a primary concern of society
everywhere. Yet the brilliance and the industry of modern
scientists have all too often been perverted by the efforts of
selfish groups to fasten the grip of monopoly on products essential
to health and welfare. There have been numerous illustrations
of the malignant effects of monopoly on national
health and on the maintenance of free enterprise in the pharmaceutical
industry. It is instructive to recall some of the more
flagrant examples of the abuse of monopoly power in the drug
and medical field.

The cartel spirit in the pharmaceutical field is exemplified
by the following paragraph, written in July 1938 by the German
company, I. G. Farbenindustrie:

"There is an agreement between German and Swiss firms of
the Chemical Pharmaceutical Industry for the protection of
original preparations which are marketed by the individual
members of the group.... This agreement provides that products
which compete with the original products of members of
the association and their subsidiaries or affiliated firms shall not
be introduced in any country throughout the world."

This agreement may be described as a conspiracy to deprive
the world of the benefits of research in new drug products
wherever such benefits may conflict with the vested interests of
any of the participating drug manufacturers.

The present war is not the first time that the United States
has found itself dependent in a period of crisis for vitally needed
drugs and medicines on cartels dominated by foreign interests.
During the first World War the scarcity of salvarsan, of veronal,
of novocaine, and similar synthetic medical products seriously
affected the health of our people. It was not until after
the war was over that we were able to relieve some of these
shortages. In the years between the World War and the present
global war cartel interests once more were able to reestablish
their monopolistic control over new pharmaceutical products.

The myth of German superiority in the production of organic
medical compounds has been dispelled for many years.
It is necessary, however, to recall that this prestige rested not
on superior skill but on the abuse of monopoly and patent privileges.
A well-known instance of the way in which the German
cartel interests sought to exploit their monopoly position is the
story of Bayer 205, sometimes called Germanin. Shortly after
the end of the World War I. G. Farben announced that it had
discovered a cure for sleeping sickness, the disease which is so
prevalent in Africa. The Germans refused to reveal the formula
for Bayer 205. Instead they sought to use their discovery
as the basis of an exchange of the secret process in return for the
restoration of Germany's lost colonies. While this bold attempt
to balance medical achievement against political advantage
is an extreme case, it nevertheless reflects a cartel attitude.

From the standpoint of the progress and growth of the
American drug industry it must be realized that the influence
of cartels has been the principal factor in keeping American
products from world markets. Foreign concerns, by making
treaties with monopoly groups in the American drug industry,
have been able to monopolize practically the entire continent of
South America. One typical agreement between an American
corporation and a German concern divided the world market
for more than 400 pharmaceutical and chemical products into
non-competitive areas. Among the fields included in the agreement
were quinine derivatives, sulfa drugs, vitamins and narcotics.
The American firm was prohibited from exporting. This
same pattern of restriction by which American producers were
barred from selling to South America has been found in a whole
roster of cartel agreements involving pharmaceutical products.
The effects of these agreements have severely handicapped our
good neighbor relations with South America and have made
more difficult the establishment of healthy trade between the
United States and Latin American countries.

If we are to succeed in our efforts to create a better postwar
world, it should be evident that we must uproot every vestige
of illegal monopoly control over products essential to the
health and welfare of our people. Whether the restriction stems
from the efforts of a cartel to confine American industry to the
domestic market, or to strangle research and production by
American concerns, or to use patents to impose unlawful restraints
on trade in the drug industry, it must be our determined
purpose to restore free enterprise in the pharmaceutical field.
Given freedom of opportunity and the incentive to enter
branches of the industry heretofore dominated by cartel interests,
we may rest assured that American drug manufacturers
will demonstrate their outstanding capabilities in research and
their ability to compete both at home and abroad. Competition
will benefit the American drug industry and permit it to attain
its maximum development. What is perhaps even more important,
this country will be assured that in the future the
health and welfare of its citizens will not be dependent upon
the arbitrary exercise of monopoly power.

I am sure that responsible persons in the pharmaceutical industry
will not argue that European technology in this field is
so superior to ours that competition is futile. If American
manufacturers have free access to technology and are not barred
by the misuse of patents and the resurrection of cartel arrangements,
then the industry will find itself in a healthier financial
and technological position as well as in a position more fully to
discharge its obligations to the American people. The myth of
European superiority in the medical field has been carefully
nurtured by foreign interests which have used this propaganda
as a commercial device. Only free competition and free enterprise
can fully dispel this myth. This cannot be done, however,
unless the pharmaceutical industry sees to it that victims of
diabetes, malaria, pellagra, rickets and arthritis are not at the
mercy of privileged groups who have abused public confidence
and exploited human suffering.

The laboratories of our pharmaceutical industry have brought
forth wonderful discoveries. Their achievements have been a
boon to the human race. But they have a responsibility to erase
the blemish caused by those few who have misused their economic
power to violate their trust.

The promotion of public welfare as well as the best interests
of the pharmaceutical industry are served when research, production
and distribution are carried on free from the taint of
monopoly. National health, like national economic well-being,
demands that freedom of opportunity to conduct research, to
engage in business, and to compete in domestic and foreign
markets be preserved. No compromise is possible with monopoly
control in an industry which is so directly concerned with
human welfare.

<i>Synthetic Hormones</i>


The use of synthetic hormones in the United States has grown
to such an extent that the annual sales amount to many millions
of dollars. Something more than half of the entire business in
this country has been carried on by four companies. Each of
these companies is the subsidiary or affiliate of a corresponding
company in Europe. The European companies belong to a
hormone cartel which has controlled the hormone business most
effectively abroad and in the United States.

After investigating the ramifications of the cartel's activities
in this country the Department of Justice prosecuted the four
American companies for violations of the antitrust laws. Pleas
of nolo contendere were entered by the four corporations and
by five of their officials and fines totalling $54,000 were assessed
and paid. At the same time, on December 17, 1941, the defendants
consented to the entry of a decree in a civil action
brought by the government, which enjoined them from further
activities in violation of the antitrust laws.

These are the basic aspects of the hormone cartel:

1. Research has been seriously affected by restrictions imposed
by foreign cartel members.

2. German interests have entered into patent licensing arrangements
with American affiliates under which they--the
latter--agreed to withhold their products from Latin American
markets.

3. During the war American companies have aided their
German affiliates in evading the British blockade.

4. American companies have participated in the use of paper
corporations and dummy consignees to avoid the effects of the
Black List in Latin America.

5. American concerns have devised deceptive labels to preserve
markets for their German affiliates and to aid the spread
of German propaganda in Latin America.

6. Members of the cartel have misused patents in schemes
to camouflage flagrant violations of the laws of the nation.

7. The recognized benefits which might be obtained by the
widespread use of hormones have been to a large extent curtailed
by reason of the restrictions and illegal policies of the
cartel members.

8. In the case of one of the synthetic hormones, there is evidence
indicating that it may have a substantial contribution to
make in connection with treatment of wounded soldiers for
shock. The cartel restrictions have had their effect upon the
production and wide use of this hormone as well as the others.

9. Two of the American companies have been taken over
by the Alien Property Custodian and one of these has been sold.

The following explanation of the nature of hormones does
not purport to be a scientific discussion. It represents my understanding
of the subject based upon what I believe to be reliable
authority. I merely give it for what it may be worth as background
for the discussion of this cartel.

Hormones are the secretions of certain ductless glands. As
they enter the bloodstream they regulate chemically practically
every function of the human body. They are really special
agents of chemical coordination of the body. They regulate,
order and correlate bodily functions with the same precision as
that achieved by the nervous system. Since their first definite
isolation by the great English physiologists, Bayliss and Starling,
in the early years of this century, there has grown up a
whole new field of research. Infinitely small amounts of certain
hormones have the most profound effects upon the human
body and its emotions. As in the case of vitamins, much of our
present knowledge is the result of observing the striking pathological
defects and abnormalities produced by excess or deficiency
of hormones.

Thus deficiency of certain of these drug-like substances from
the small thyroid gland causes a marked decrease in metabolism
and mental and physical sluggishness. Excess of this same hormone,
or complex of substances, has the opposite effect, increasing
oxidation and pulse rate, and causing nervousness and emaciation.
It also has striking effects upon growth and development.
Deficiency in children results in dwarfism and idiocy.

Other hormones such as those from the anterior lobe of the
pituitary gland affect the growth of bone. Hormones from the
adrenal glands, located near the kidneys, cause constriction of
blood vessels, accelerate the heart beat and cause discharge of
glucose from the liver. Insulin, one of the most widely known
of the hormones, plays an essential role in the metabolism of
carbohydrates. Its absence causes diabetes which is characterized
by a failure of normal carbohydrate metabolism.

Medical investigators and chemists have been exploring this
vast new field of research for many years. They have learned
more and more about the actions and composition of these complex
substances. For many years they have worked with the
extracts from the glands of certain animals to obtain the hormone
itself, or as much of it as could be saved in the process of
extraction. At the same time they have been analyzing the composition
of the hormones, and endeavoring to synthesize the
active principles. Among those which have been produced in
synthetic form are the male sex hormone, testosterone; the follicular
and corpus luteum, both being female sex hormones; and
desoxycorticosterone acetate, a synthetic substance which has
effects similar to those of cortin.

Cortin is derived from the cortex of the adrenal glands.
There is still some question as to the role which this hormone
plays, but there is no doubt that it is essential to life. It apparently
affects the metabolism of sodium, potassium, and carbohydrates.
This hormone plays an important role in the
concentration of body fluids and their distribution between the
inside and outside of body cells. The hormone is therefore of
some use in diseases or conditions where there occur marked
changes in the distribution of the body fluids. Specifically, it
means the hormones of the adrenal cortex are useful in the treatment
of Addison's disease, where it seems to strike a balance in
the intake of salt. It has also been suggested that since surgical
shock is associated with unbalance of body fluids, this hormone
may be of value in counteracting the shock effects. Shock is
so complex a condition, however, that there is no general agreement
on the effects of the hormone. However, the hormone,
or crystalline preparations possessing hormonal activity, are
being used by army surgeons both here and abroad for whatever
value they possess.

It is with these and certain other pharmaceutical specialties
that the hormone cartel has concerned itself. The cartel is composed
of five large European companies: Schering A. G. (Berlin);
Ciba (Basle); N. J. Organon (Oss, Holland); C. F.
Boehringer & Sons (Mannheim); and Chimio (France). Each
of the first four has had a subsidiary or affiliate in this country
which has been used to carry out the policies of the European
company and of the cartel. I shall describe in some detail the
practices which were followed in aiding the German companies
to avoid the effect of the British blockade and Black List in
Latin America.

The Schering A. G. firm is one of the most important pharmaceutical
and chemical manufacturers in Germany. It makes
photographic supplies, soaps, cosmetics and many other products.
However by far the largest part of its production consists
of medicinal specialties and fine chemicals, the former being the
more important. It is the largest German exporter of pharmaceutical
and medical specialties, specializing in sex hormones,
vaccines, remedies for venereal and other contagious diseases,
rheumatism, tuberculosis, etc., and also laxatives, anti-acids, opiates,
etc. It is also one of the larger German exporters of fine
chemicals, laboratory chemicals and plant protection chemicals.

At the time of the first World War, Schering A. G. did comparatively
little export business. Its export system, established
and carefully developed after 1918, is mainly the result of the
work of one man, its former president Dr. Julius Weltzien.
This export system spreads over the entire world. The procedure
in establishing outlets abroad has been as follows: At
first sales are made to all who may wish to buy; then, with increasing
turnover, a local firm is made sole agent. When the
yearly turnover reaches about $25,000, an expert sent from Berlin
is coordinated with the sole agency firm. When the yearly
turnover exceeds about $50,000, Schering A. G. sets up a firm of
its own, directed by managers sent from Berlin. Germans, or
men of German descent, are placed in all key positions, and the
remainder of the staff is partly German, partly persons of the
country in which the agency is located. The final step is to set
up factories in the most important markets which are equipped
to ampule the finished solutions and to tablet the finished substances
which are used in that form. The supervision of all
firms abroad is strongly centralized in Berlin.

Until recently, Schering A. G. was one of the largest sellers
of pharmaceutical and medicinal specialties in South and Central
America. Testimony before the Truman Committee indicated
that approximately one-third of all materials shipped into South
America by airmail over the German controlled <i>Lati</i> airline,
during a six months period in 1941, were chemical and pharmaceutical
products. Approximately the same amount of books,
maps, etc., intended for espionage and propaganda work was
also shipped by air since it was the only means of avoiding the
British blockade. On the return trips four-fifths of the air
cargoes were of mica for the Nazi war machine and most of the
remaining fifth was made up of other important war materials.
The important role played by the pharmaceutical exports in providing
the exchange for purchase of war materials should not
be overlooked.

The interruption of exports due to the war caused Schering
A. G. to adopt several different methods of continuing its foreign
business. Prior to the invasion of Belgium and Holland,
firms in those countries and in the Scandinavian countries were
used as blinds to avoid the British blockade. Before Italy
entered the war, the Milan factory was utilized as a point from
which the German goods, labeled in Italy, could be sent out to
the rest of the world.

The final step was to transfer to the United States the business
of supplying the markets cut off by the blockade. In
preparation for this emergency, several measures had been
taken long before the actual outbreak of the war.

The center of the new supply system was Schering Corporation
(Bloomfield, New Jersey), a firm now held by the U. S.
Alien Property Custodian. This firm was established as a
Schering A. G. subsidiary in 1929 to manufacture medical specialties
for the market in this country. Differing from most
other Schering factories outside Germany it developed the
finished solutions and substances out of raw or semi-manufactured
imported materials, where the others merely finished the
process by placing the material in ampule, tablet and package
form. Gradually extending its research, laboratory and manufacturing
facilities it came to be as fully equipped to manufacture,
although on a much smaller scale, all Schering medical
specialties as Schering A. G. itself.

All of the common stock of this New Jersey corporation was
owned by Chemical and Pharmaceutical Enterprises, Ltd.
(Chepha) and held in the name of a nominee of the Swiss Bank.
Chepha was owned 51 per cent by the Swiss Bank and 49 per
cent by other related interests. However, it has recently come
to light that the transaction in 1937 by which Chepha and the
Swiss Bank got apparent control of the Schering Corporation,
included an option agreement which made it possible for Schering
A. G. to regain its interest at any time it so desired. Obviously
the transaction was a mere sham to make it appear that
the American corporation was controlled from Switzerland
rather than from Germany. Actually Schering A. G. had never
ceased to exercise its domination over Schering Corporation up
to the very outbreak of war between Germany and the United
States.

As of January 1, 1938 the two corporations entered into an
extensive and detailed agreement. Two paragraphs of the preamble
of this agreement are as follows:

"Schering A. G. is engaged in the development, manufacture
and/or sale of medicinal, pharmaceutical, biological, and bacteriological
preparations. It is the owner of processes and
formulae used in the production of such preparations and is also
the owner of U. S. A. patents and patent applications pertaining
to such preparations. For many years it has maintained and operated
and still does maintain and operate laboratories to carry
on research and development work in connection with such preparations,
and has thereby acquired valuable scientific knowledge,
data and material concerning the aforesaid sphere of activities.

"Schering Corp. has an organization suited for national distribution
and promotion of such preparations in the United
States of America, and is equipped to manufacture such preparations.
It also maintains and operates laboratories to carry
on research and development work in connection with such
preparations, but has not acquired the extensive scientific knowledge
and practical experience in this field that Schering A. G.
commands by reason of its longer and more extensive research
work and experience."

This language portrays the true relationship of the parent
and subsidiary companies.

The parties agreed to exchange patents and information and
to deal in each other's products in their respective territories.
The division of territory, as in so many of these German-American
agreements, gave the United States to the American corporation
as its territory and the remainder of the world to the
German firm.

Article V, Paragraph 5 is as follows:

"Schering A. G. agrees not to deal in selected preparations
nor to sell selected preparations to any corporation or person
in the U. S. A. except to Schering Corp., nor knowingly to sell
them to any corporation or person for purposes of exportation
to or resale in the U. S. A. unless Schering Corp. shall first
have given its written consent."

Article V, Paragraph 7 is as follows:

"Schering Corp. undertakes not to export, either directly or
indirectly, from the U. S. A., or knowingly to sell for purposes
of export to any third party any such preparations unless Schering
A. G. shall have previously given its written consent."

A letter from Schering Corporation to Schering A. G. dated
June 2, 1939 contained the following:

"In view of your assignment to us of certain patents in the
female-sex-hormone field and your assistance in connection with
the acquisition by us of licenses under patents in the male-sex-hormone
and cortin fields, we agree not to sell or offer for sale
any product made pursuant to the said assigned and/or licensed
patents or any of them in any country outside of the U. S."

All Schering A. G. patents and trademarks in the United
States are owned by Schering Corporation or its affiliates. However,
the agreement is not limited in its terms to the mere fixing
of compensation for the use of patents and trademarks. The
American corporation agreed to pay Schering A. G. a royalty
on all its sales of pharmaceutical products which had nothing
to do with Schering A. G. patents and trademarks. It even
went so far as to agree to pay the German firm a royalty of not
to exceed 12-1/2 per cent on sales of new preparations developed
by itself in this country. The following provisions of Article
X of the agreement make clear this unusual relationship:

"In either of such cases [if net sales of Saraka, a proprietary
laxative, are more or less than $1,200,000] the royalty shall
be as follows:

"(b) On that portion of such amount derived from sales of
preparations commonly available in the open market and not
sold under a trademark, such as insulin, milk of magnesia, thyroid,
or codliver oil, and in the manufacture of which no special
Schering A. G. process is utilized, 6-1/4%;

(c) On that portion of such amount derived from sales of
new preparations developed by Schering Corp, wholly independent
of Schering A. G. and which do not fall within a field
of preparations already developed or in process of development
by Schering A. G., a percentage, less than 12-1/2%, to be determined
and agreed upon by the parties from time to time."

Up to the outbreak of the war there was a constant exchange
of experience and knowledge by frequent mutual visits. This
differs radically from the conditions which prevailed in many
other fields. In the case of synthetic rubber for instance, the
Hitler government flatly prohibited the giving out of technical
information while using every means of securing the information
of developments in this country. It seems obvious that in
the case of Schering A. G., the plan, as subsequently carried
out, was to place Schering Corporation in a position of being
able to carry on Schering A. G.'s overseas business. In this
rapidly changing field of hormones, this meant keeping the
American corporation completely informed as well as getting
from it all available information.

Schering Corporation, before the outbreak of war, was provided
with complete instructions about the technicalities of exporting
Schering products, with a complete set of Schering export
packages, labels, prescriptions, etc., indicating all details
of the complicated system of packages which differ from country
to country and from product to product. This was done to
enable Schering Corporation to start exporting without delay
in case of emergency. For these products which, before the
war had not been made by Schering Corporation, the necessary
manufacturing directions were sent from Berlin. About these
products until as recently as 1941 there was a constant exchange
between Bloomfield and Berlin.

In addition to establishing a "neutral" manufacturer and supplier
in the United States which in case of emergency could
be resorted to as a new center of the overseas business, Schering
A. G. took other measures as well. The Schering subsidiary in
London, Schering, Ltd., was also sold to Chepha. It is understood
that it has since been or is being wound up by the British
government. Shortly before the outbreak of the war in 1939,
all Schering A. G. firms in the British Empire, except London,
and those in Latin America, were transferred to Foreign Investments
and Invention Company, Ltd. Basle (Forinvent.) This
was done to "neutralize" these Schering firms and thus to protect
them from seizure in the British Empire or blacklisting
in Latin America. Forinvent is wholly owned by Palladium
A. G., also a Swiss holding company which in turn is wholly
owned by the Swiss Bank Corporation, Basle. Forinvent, like
Chepha, is within the premises and organization of the Swiss
Bank. The president is the same Dr. Samuel Schweitzer of the
Swiss Bank, who is in charge of Chepha, and the connections of
Forinvent and Chepha with the Swiss Bank are practically identical.
Due to the fact that the selling transaction in the case of
Forinvent took place immediately before the outbreak of war,
Forinvent could not escape being placed on the blacklist. The
same holds true for the Forinvent (Schering A. G.) subsidiaries
in Latin America, while the Forinvent (Schering A. G.) subsidiaries
in the British countries were placed under enemy alien
control.

The carefully laid plans were put into effect upon the outbreak
of war. Forinvent advised the British Empire companies
to get their further supplies from Schering Corporation and at
the same time advised the latter to supply them, which it did.

The fact that the British government acted quickly and placed
Forinvent and its subsidiaries in Latin America on the blacklist
partially upset the plans which had been made. In view of the
increasing anti-German attitude in the United States and the
possibility of this country entering the war sooner or later,
Schering Corporation had to be very careful of its outward connections
with the Schering A. G. set-up. Therefore when Schering
Corporation was finally advised to supply Latin America,
steps were taken to conceal any connections with the blacklisted
Forinvent firms. On January 2, 1940 Schering A. G. gave a
release to Schering Corporation as to all products excepting hormones,
and on March 1, 1940, cabled a blanket release in the
following terms: "We authorize you until further notice to deliver
pharmaceutical and technical chemicals to our South and
Central American representatives or through their mediation
to their customers." These releases, of course, did not apply to
foreign firms not associated with Schering A. G., and evidence
shows that the restrictions as to these other companies were still
continued, and Schering Corporation refused to sell to them.

Two paper corporations were created to avoid use of the name
Schering although both corporations are in the same building
with Schering Corporation and are completely identified with
it except as to name. Pharmex, Inc., owned by Gregory Stragnell,
vice president of Schering Corporation, dealt directly with
the ex-Schering A. G. subsidiaries in the British Empire, except
Schering Corporation, Limited, of Canada. The latter deals
directly with Schering Corporation of Bloomfield.

Delta Pharmaceutical Corporation, owned by Sherka Chemical
Company (which was in turn owned by Chepha), purchased
raw materials from Sherka and hormone products from Schering
Corporation and sold them to Atlantis, a corporation organized
in Panama. These two companies, Pharmex and Delta, were
really the export department of Schering Corporation. Part of
their employees were on the pay roll of Schering and part on the
pay rolls of Pharmex, Delta and Sherka. Both companies were
under the direction of Dr. Weltzien and Dr. Stragnell, then
president and vice president, respectively, of Schering Corp.

Atlantis S. A., Panama, is a wholly owned subsidiary of Forinvent
organized in 1940. Its president is Dr. Samuel Schweitzer,
who is likewise in charge of Chepha and Forinvent. At first it
was considered advisable to set up an actual office in Panama.
However since so many technical questions, passport difficulties
and tax questions were involved, the whole Atlantis business
was centralized in Basle, Switzerland, under the direct supervision
of the Swiss Bank Corporation, in closest cooperation
with Schering A. G. of Berlin.

One of the problems faced by Schering Corporation in its
new foreign trade was that of packaging and labeling the products
so that they would seem to be identical with those formerly
supplied by Schering A. G. Since one of the chief considerations
prompting this whole scheme was preservation of good will,
in order that the business could be turned back to Schering A. G.
after the war, this factor was most important. On February
10, 1940 Forinvent cabled Pharmex as follows: "fundamental
changes of packing latinamerica may jeopardize turnover on account
customers mentality and will probably cause difficulties
with registration authorities therefore please adopt present
style of packing and labeling ... suggest airmailing you immediately
films for making plates [for printing Schering A. G.
type of labels]." It was not necessary to use the films in question
inasmuch as Delta had samples of all the Latin America
packages it had used as a standard pattern. Delta on January
28, 1941, sent to Swiss Bank samples of all packages used for
export, pointing out that the differences between the new and
old packages were very slight.

From early in 1940 until Pearl Harbor the supplying of
Schering A. G. firms in Latin America was accomplished in a
circuitous manner. Each of the firms kept in close touch with
Basle and so with Berlin. They advised Atlantis of their requirements.
Atlantis, in Basle, cabled the orders to Delta at
Bloomfield and instructed Swiss Bank in New York to honor
Delta's drafts. Delta delivered the goods to a forwarding agent
of Atlantis in New York, which shipped them to a dummy consignee
in Latin America and they were there received by the
particular Schering firm which had placed the order.

About 40 or 45 cents of each dollar paid by the Latin American
firm went to Atlantis and thus to Schering A. G. Out of
its share, 55 or 60 cents, Delta (actually Schering Corporation)
made its manufacturing costs and whatever profit there might
be for it. The advertising expense was borne by Atlantis or
Schering A. G. The advertising and continuance of the familiar
German packages, labels and Schering trade-mark constituted
an important form of German propaganda. It was possible for
the German agents in Latin America to point to the continuance
of German pharmaceutical supplies as indicative of their ability
to overcome the British blockade and to carry on their commerce
with this hemisphere.

It has been mentioned that the Germans used pharmaceuticals
which have a high value in proportion to bulk and weight to
make up one third of the air cargoes which were flown into
South America along with propaganda and other materials.
Pharmaceuticals also constituted an important part of the air
cargo which was carried eastward, ranking third among the
materials which were flown over the blockade. One order of
10 kilos (22 pounds) of testosterone propionate, the semi-manufactured
male hormone, valued at $50,000 was shipped
one kilo a week by air mail from Argentina to Spain and from
there to the Schering factory at either Milan or Berlin. This
and other similar orders, were placed by a dummy of Schering
A. G. in Portugal.

Thus far I have been discussing the relations of two firms,
one, the largest of the European manufacturers of synthetic
hormones, and the other its affiliate or subsidiary, the largest
American producer. There are other large European members
of the cartel and each has its subsidiary in this country.

Ciba (Society of Chemical Industry in Basle, Switzerland) is
another important cartel member. It has been in existence for
some sixty years, engaged in the manufacture and sale of dyestuffs
and pharmaceutical products throughout the world. In
July 1936 it organized a subsidiary, Ciba Pharmaceutical Products,
Inc., of Summit, New Jersey. Ciba Basle also came to own
several other corporations in fields other than pharmaceuticals
and hormones in this country, and companies in Canada, Brazil
and Argentina which sell dyestuffs and pharmaceuticals. Ciba's
close relation to Schering A. G. is indicated by its joint ownership
with the Swiss Bank of the common stock of Chepha, which
in turn owns all the common stock of Schering Corporation.

Until just before the war Ciba Pharmaceutical of Summit,
New Jersey, produced no hormone products. These were all
purchased by it from Ciba Basle. However, since its organization
it has been distributing hormones under its own label.

The subservient attitude of Ciba Summit to the Society (Ciba,
Basle) is clearly shown in the following paragraph from a letter
of October 17, 1939, from H. Kamp, vice president of the New
Jersey corporation, to James Brodbeck, Secretary of Ciba Basle:

"As I have repeatedly said, I am not interested in making
profits for Summit out of sales of raw materials or even finished
packages sent to foreign countries. <i>All I am interested in is to
help Society in getting the business</i>, but we must have a certain
rule as regards profits for Summit. The simplest way would
be if Basle fixed a percentage profit over our price II on all
products shipped in bulk to any foreign country. The same, of
course, could apply to finished packages if we were to supply
finished packages to foreign countries later on. <i>We want to
help Society as I fully realize that we are working for the interest
of Society and not for the interest of Ciba Summit alone.
Whatever seems most advantageous from your point of view
will meet with my approval.</i>"

The same attitude is also reflected in a letter of September
22, 1939 from H. Kamp of Ciba Summit to Dr. J. Weltzien,
president of Schering Corporation:

"At the meeting which took place on May 10, 1939 in your
offices, among other points, the introduction of desoxycorticosterone
acetate was discussed. It was finally agreed that Ciba
would introduce the product, but would abide by your suggestion
that no other indications be mentioned in the literature than
Addison's Disease. We were, therefore, more than surprised
to read your advertisement in the 'Druggists Circular' announcing
'CORTATE,' where it is suggested that the drug
may be of use in the more chronic constitutional types of cortical
deficiency, in asthenias, and that certain allergies should be
benefited by the administration of Cortate....

"It is again one of your usual methods by putting the other
parties before accomplished facts. I have discussed your tactics
very thoroughly while in Basle, and I can assure you that our
friends in Basle are more than fed up with your <i>methods. In
fact, I have the full authority to give you a dose of your own
medicine at the next opportunity, and this I am going to do
without any hesitation whatsoever!</i>"

N. V. Organon of Oss, Holland, is a large manufacturer of
hormone products and so is F. Hoffman-LaRoche of Basle,
Switzerland. The latter company has had a subsidiary in Nutley,
New Jersey called Hoffman-LaRoche, Inc. N. V. Organon
of Oss and Hoffman-LaRoche, Inc., of Nutley, have
jointly owned a corporation called Roche-Organon, Inc., organized
in 1937 and engaged in the sale of hormones. In 1940
Ciba licensed Roche-Organon to manufacture products in the
cortin field under a patent for which it had made application in
1938. Ciba agreed to pay Roche-Organon 20 per cent of all
royalties collected from other licensees except Schering. Roche-Organon
agreed to pay Ciba 6 per cent on its entire turnover in
the United States in the Cortin field from January 1, 1940 to
June 17, 1955 regardless of whether the turnover involved
products made under Ciba's patent.

The German firm of C. F. Boehringer and Sons of Mannheim-Waldhof,
Germany formerly owned 50 per cent of the
stock of Rare Chemicals, Inc., Nepera Park, New York. The
president of the German firm was the father of E. T. Fritzsching,
formerly secretary and more recently president of Rare
Chemicals. A memorandum of the younger Fritzsching of
Rare, dated March 29, 1939, contains the following opening
paragraph:

"In view of the boycott situation and in view of a number of
other reasons I have come to the conclusion that the best way
to avoid any further trouble for Rare Chemicals is to arrange
for a definite purchase of the Boehringer shares by an American
citizen. It is my intention to make an offer to Boehringer, by
which I shall take over their assets in this country and pay for
them at whatever price I could possibly obtain them. I am assuming
this obligation personally for the reason that it really
makes very little difference whether the shares are owned by
Boehringer or by me, since through this transaction the assets
would morally still remain within the same family interests.
It would also work along the lines of my personal interest and
that of my family in the event of war."

The remaining 50 per cent of Rare's stock was owned by
Pyridium Corporation also of Nepera Park, New York. A letter
to Erwin Fritzsching c/o C. F. Boehringer & Soehne,
G.m.b.H., Mannheim-Waldhof from W. S. Lasdon of Pyridium
and president of Rare dated August 18, 1939 contained the
following statement: "I agree with your suggestion to the transfer
of the B.&S. stock to a Swiss Company, instead of to you, and
of course, your participation in the profits of Rare is to be cancelled
upon the signing of this agreement, the understanding
being that you and W. S. Lasdon will represent the stockholding
interests." The products of the two companies were exchanged
with definite restrictions upon their distribution. The following
excerpt indicates that the German firm kept a tight rein on
the use by the American firm of the former's products. It is
taken from a letter from Fritzsching of C. F. Boehringer &
Soehne, G.m.b.H. to Rare Chemicals, Inc., dated October 31,
1936. It concerns a request of Rare to be allowed to manufacture
a product called Eucupin.

"We are acknowledging the receipt of your letter of October
19th and regret to say that we cannot comply with your wishes.

"We must take into consideration also the German interest
when weighing the question whether it is right to send manufacturing
processes to foreign countries, even though they may
go to our friends in these countries. We cannot be responsible
for it to give you manufacturing processes, the use of which is
not to be expected within a reasonable time. In such a case
we cannot truthfully answer any possible questions from authorities
to the effect that we can say that when giving away a manufacturing
process it will make it possible to manufacture and sell
in a foreign country a German preparation, the sale of which
from Germany due to duty difficulties and other restrictions
cannot be considered. In this fact lies the German interest,
and this we have to consider in first line."

In the summer of 1942 Rare was taken over by the Alien
Property Custodian and subsequently sold at public auction to
a wholly American independent organization.

After certain separate agreements and considerable negotiation
a five party agreement was entered into on May 26, 1937
to which the European firms Schering A. G.; Ciba, Basle; N.
V. Organon, Oss, Holland; C. F. Boehringer & Sons, and Les
Laboratoires Francais de Chimiotherapie of France (Chimio)
were the parties. The male hormone, female sex hormones, and
cortin, the cortico adrenal hormone, are covered by the agreement.
It involved a division of territories with certain parties
being definitely excluded from certain territories. Competing
producers of pharmaceutical products were expressly named as
firms with which any kind of cooperation is prohibited. Among
these were E. Merck, Darmstadt, Germany, and Merck & Co.,
Inc., of Rahway, New Jersey. Subsequent agreements removed
the prohibition as to these firms.

Of course, one of the chief purposes of the cartel agreement
was to fix prices. The European parties agreed upon prices and
their American affiliates did likewise. A memorandum of a
meeting held at Summit on October 6, 1938 between representatives
of Ciba and of Schering discusses the fixing of prices on
various hormones. The artificial and arbitrary character of the
pricing policies is indicated by quotations from some of the documents
which were written following this meeting. One of them
indicates an agreed price of $3 for a certain hormone product.
It then states: "This price was later refused by Mr. Kamp
[Ciba's general manager] who then advocated $4.00. This
was submitted to the other with our O.K."

A memorandum of a discussion held at Bloomfield, New
Jersey on October 7, 1938 between representatives of Rare and
of Schering, recites a detailed list of prices agreed upon between
Schering and Ciba the preceding day as having been
submitted to Rare.

As to the item on which the price had been changed as just
indicated an endorsement on this memorandum states: "Informed
Mr. Landon [Rare official] by phone of Summit's desire
to change this price to $4. He agreed to this."

The entire world cartel system has been bound together with
patents. The contracts among the American companies have
been carefully planned and drafted abroad to avoid any appearance
of violating the antitrust laws. They were couched in
terms of licensing patents to give the impression that the parties
were merely procuring rights under patents and not engaging
in restraints of competition. The evidence indicates that the
cartel participants in Europe had attempted to allocate the issue
of patents in the United States to the associated firms in such
a manner as to strengthen the defense of the American firms
against charges of antitrust law violations. At a discussion in
Berlin on March 18, 1939 among representatives of Ciba, Organon,
and Schering, A. G. there was set in motion reciprocal
concessions of priority in interferences between Organon and
Ciba in the U. S. Patent Office relating to the male hormone,
and to cortin. It was arranged for Schering to drop out of the
interference proceedings. It appears from a circular letter from
Organon to Ciba and Schering that the plan was for Organon
to concede priority to Ciba in the male hormone interference
and for Ciba to concede priority in the interference regarding
cortin. The intent of the parties, as to the male hormone interference,
was to transfer the application of Organon to the
United States Ciba firm. This circular letter of April 4, 1939,
from Ciba to Organon and Schering, A. G. reads in part:

"It is up to Ciba to take care in accordance with the several
single agreements in the United States for a correct and clear
basis of the agreements relating to the male hormone field because
corresponding proceedings are intended in the paranephros
[cortin] hormone field in which Roche-Organon shall
obtain the basic patent claims. In accordance with the opinion
expressed here since Ciba gives its consent already in the letter
of March 9, 1939 to transfer the basic application in which the
patent claims for paranephros are established (Case 1577/1-4)
to Roche-Organon, that however, is dependent upon corresponding
proceedings of the Organon in the male hormone field."

The reasons for this "swapping" were very clearly indicated
in the last mentioned document:

"As it is known in the United States the antitrust legislation
is of extremely great significance. The different agreements
which are in the state of preparation in the United States are
intended to put all contractors into position to sell hormone
compounds in the United States without any violation of those
statutes.... So far as ... cross promises to maintain prices
exist, this promise is only lawful if the licensee, in this case
Ciba, possesses the protection of a patent claim....

<tb>

"According to the information of Dr. Joseph Engi almost
daily new indictments based on the antitrust legislation are
made. Under such circumstances it is extremely important to
obtain as fast as possible the protection of the most important
patent claims."

However, Roche-Organon resisted the transfer of the application,
writing in its circular letter to Ciba and Schering, A. G.,
dated April 15, 1939: "An expert would understand immediately
that the transfer of this application served only aims which
have to be considered as lawful according to the antitrust legislation.
We couldn't even mention any consideration given the
Ciba."

Although Organon's male hormone application was in fact
not transferred to Ciba, the result which the parties contemplated
appears to have been effected. Ciba, apparently relying
upon its own male hormone patents in the United States, became
the licensor of Roche, Schering, and Rare, while Roche-Organon
participated in the licensing arrangements only under
its cortin patents.

There are numerous indications in the Schering correspondence
that the American license agreements are so bound up with
the basic cartel agreements that the sums of money paid by the
American firms to each other are regarded as parts of the total
considerations which the European firms are bound to pay each
other.

As in the case of Schering A. G. and Schering Corporation the
other cartel members bound their United States affiliates to
agreements which precluded exports in any manner which would
interfere with the division of territory among members of the
cartel. The agreement of April 1, 1938 between N. V. Organon
and Roche-Organon contains the following provisions:
"Roche-Organon agrees not to deal in or manufacture glandular
and hormone preparations other than those originated by
Oss [N. V. Organon], nor to export or sell for export from the
territory any glandular and hormone preparations." (The territory
is defined as the United States, its territories and possessions,
Canada and the Philippine Islands, and Cuba.) The other
agreements contain similar restrictions with some variations as
to the exact territory.

The principles of competition, price, and research heretofore
discussed are well exemplified by the case of Stilbestrol (diethylstilbestrol),
a recently discovered pharmaceutical which
has effects similar to those of the female sex hormones. It is
the product of research supported by Government grant in
England, several scientists of the University of London and of
Oxford University, headed by E. C. Dodds, being responsible
for the development. Throughout all of the work of Dodds
and his colleagues the Medical Research Council, a British government
organization, undertook the necessary financial support.
(While Stilbestrol is not a synthetic hormone, it has most of the
valuable therapeutic effects of these substances although it may
not be entirely free from side reactions. Its cost of manufacture--and
the price to the consumer--are much lower than
those of the equivalent hormones).

The American hormone cartel members were aware of Stilbestrol
and its possibilities as early as 1939. In a conference
of Roche-Organon, Ciba and Schering officials, held on August
1, 1939 the following discussion took place, according to
minutes found in Ciba's files:

"Mr. Kamp [Ciba] brought up the subject stilbestrol.

"Mr. Hammer [Schering] said he thought that any concern
would have a hard time getting stilbestrol accepted in this country.

"Dr. Oppenheimer [Ciba] pointed out that in this country
estradiol prices may not be too much out of line with those of
stilbestrol compared with Great Britain.

"The question of side effects from stilbestrol was then discussed.

"Dr. Josephy [Roche-Organon] told of reports from Amsterdam
on the use of stilbestrol in animal experimentation. He
said that he thought the government would look not only at
the favorable reports on a preparation which was submitted but
also the unfavorable ones.

"Mr. Kamp said he thought some concern had already filed
with the government a request to market stilbestrol."

A memorandum in Schering's file concerning this same conference
of August 1, 1939 is somewhat more revealing:

"XVIII <i>Stilbestrol</i>. Ciba and Roche-Organon want to have
it just to be able to knock it with physicians. They say the hormone
business in England has been destroyed just by this new
product. On the other hand, it is said to injure the liver and
there is doubt that the U. S. Government will allow it to be
used."

In the minutes (from Ciba's files) of a conference of representatives
of the three companies on Friday, October 27, 1939,
there is this statement: "During the discussion Stilbestrol was
mentioned and Dr. Weltzien [President of Schering] remarked
he hoped 'none of us will introduce Stilbestrol'." These quotations
indicate the hostility of cartel members towards a new
product which endangers their control of the market. Stilbestrol
was put on the market in this country late in 1941 and had an
immediate effect upon the sales of the higher priced hormone
products.

From what has been said it seems clear that in the field of
synthetic hormones the cartel control has been such as to be
detrimental to our national interest. When such control can
be used to make American corporations the tools of those of
other countries it is exceedingly unfortunate. When carried to
the point of causing corporations in this country to aid the Axis
it could not be and was not tolerated. The seizure of two of
these companies by the Alien Property Custodian has put an
end to the German control. From the point of view of encouragement
of research those two companies are much better
off than they were when tied to the apron strings of their parent
companies in Germany. Complete removal of cartel restrictions
from the entire industry would be definitely in the interest
of the general public in this country and throughout the world.

<i>Vitamins</i>


The monopolistic control of one of the most essential products
of our modern era--the sunshine vitamin, also known as
Vitamin D--has been magnified by the fact that it is the poorer
elements of our country which have the greatest need for this
product, since it is a preventative and a cure for certain diseases
most commonly found among the lower economic strata of our
population. Vitamin D is essential for proper bone growth and
development, the prevention and cure of rickets, and the prevention
or reduction of tooth decay.

The Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation acts as a screen
behind which a group of monopolistic chemical, pharmaceutical
and food companies control Vitamin D. The story of the Wisconsin
Alumni Research Foundation is of extreme importance
because it indicates how a quasi-public research organization
can be flagrantly misused.

At the outset I should like to state that the Wisconsin Alumni
Research Foundation has no formal connection with the University
of Wisconsin, and that the University of Wisconsin has
absolutely no control over the policies and practices of the
Alumni Foundation. It should be clearly understood, therefore,
that what I say here does not reflect in any manner upon
the University of Wisconsin.

A report of the Trustees of the Foundation dated June 22,
1931, defines the objectives and purposes of the Foundation
as follows:

"Indeed one of the soundest reasons for the development of
the Foundation as a suitable means of handling the Steenbock
process lies in the rigid control through which it is possible to
protect the public and prevent unscrupulous commercialism
from capitalizing the Steenbock discovery."

The investigation by the Antitrust Division of the Department
of Justice indicates, however, that somewhere along the
line these laudable objectives were lost. Instead, a summary
of our investigation discloses the following facts about the Wisconsin
Alumni Research Foundation:

(1) It has been the vehicle for creating a domestic monopoly
resulting in division of fields, price fixing, control of container
size, and limitation of potency of vitamin products--as a result
of which the public has been charged excessive and arbitrarily
high prices. (The Foundation has been described by a licensee
as being "merciless in beating out competition" in the field of
vitamins.)

(2) It has considered plans to denature and adulterate Vitamin
D preparations in order to maintain high prices.

(3) It has exhibited a lack of interest in research unless a
commercial advantage could be obtained.

(4) It has used threats of patent litigations under patents
which it knew were very weak to eliminate competition. (Some
of these patents upon which the monopolistic scheme rested
were, in fact, declared invalid in 1943 by the Circuit Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.)

(5) It has suppressed the use of competing processes.

(6) It has organized international cartels with I. G. Farben
of Germany and Joseph Nathan & Co., of Great Britain, in
order to eliminate world competition by dividing world territory
into noncompetitive areas.

(7) It has attempted to suppress the publication of scientific
research data which were at variance with its monopoly interests.

(8) It has acted as a police organization for its licensees--in
order to maintain its price fixing arrangements--by setting
up a black list of price-cutting distributors.

(9) It has used its licensing scheme to discourage research
by its licensees.

(10) It has endeavored to suppress or prevent truthful
advertising in order to eliminate competition.

(11) It has required its licenses to charge unreasonable
prices to the government.

(12) It has forced farmers to buy vitamin-enriched animal
feeds in a monopoly market.

Since 1925 the production and use of Vitamin D has been
under the control of the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation.
The control has been based upon the so-called Steenbock
patents, especially upon patent No. 1680818, which the Foundation
regards as the basic patent on Vitamin D.

About 1925 Dr. Steenbock, then a professor at the University
of Wisconsin, conducted experiments which eventually resulted
in the Steenbock patents. Recognizing the commercial possibilities
of his developments, Steenbock offered his patents to
the University, but the Regents of the institution did not feel
they were in a position to commercialize them. The President
of the Wisconsin Alumni Association at that time was George I.
Haight, a very able patent lawyer of Chicago, who immediately
recognized the commercial possibilities of the Steenbock
development. Together with some of the other leading alumni
of the University, Haight founded the Wisconsin Alumni Research
Foundation to undertake the exploitation of the Steenbock
patents and such other patents as the Foundation might
from time to time acquire.

The Foundation was chartered on November 14, 1925 as a
non-profit corporation. Its purposes, as stated in its charter
were "to promote, encourage and aid scientific investigation
and research at the University of Wisconsin by the faculty,
staff, alumni and students thereof, and those associated therewith,
and to provide or assist in providing the means and machinery
by which their scientific discoveries, inventions and
processes may be developed, applied and patented, and the public
and commercial uses thereof determined, and by which such
utilization or disposition may be made of such discoveries, inventions
and processes, and patent rights or interests therein, as
may tend to stimulate and promote and provide funds for further
scientific investigation and research within said University
or colleges or departments thereof."

The Foundation is managed by a Board of Trustees. Originally
these trustees personally handled the work of the Foundation
but, in 1931, they secured the services of Henry L. Russell,
former dean of the University of Wisconsin College of Agriculture.
Russell was made Director and executive head of the
Foundation. Later, as business increased, L. D. Barney was
employed as business manager, and Ward Ross, an associate of
Haight, was retained as General Counsel. Steenbock himself
appears to have handled most of the technical matters of the
Foundation insofar as they relate to Vitamin D. The royalties
received by the Foundation are invested and the resulting income
is utilized for research.

The Foundation has controlled Vitamin D by reason of its
ownership of the Steenbock patents Nos. 1680818, 1871135,
1871136, and 2057399. The underlying concept of all of these
patents is that certain substances called pro-vitamins may be
"activated" so as to result in a product having a high Vitamin
D potency. This "activation" is accomplished by exposing the
pro-vitamin to ultra-violet light, and the basic patent is limited
to activation by ultra-violet light produced by an artificial
source such as a quartz mercury vapor lamp.

The commercialization of the Steenbock patents was phenomenally
successful almost from the very outset. The report
of the Trustees of the Foundation dated June 22, 1931, states:

"The accumulation from royalties so far has been almost
wholly from the ultra-violet patents. During the calendar year
1930, the gross income was $354,590, or very nearly $1,000 a
day throughout the year. This income has been developed
within less than three years."

The Foundation's annual royalties showed a steady increase
until 1936, when they amounted to nearly $1,100,000. After
1936, the annual royalties decreased slightly, and in 1939 they
amounted to $936,610.70 or over $2,500 per day. Up to 1940,
the Foundation had received more than $8,500,000 in royalties.

The royalty rates charged by the Foundation vary from 10%
to 3% and less, with higher royalties applying to only a few
products. The enormous size of the market is indicated by the
munificent revenues yielded by royalties at these rates.

The first requirement for the success of the Foundation's
licensing program was the elimination of competition from non-*licensees.
The Foundation's practices in this respect are aptly
described in a memorandum dated February 20, 1935, from
Connolly, a du Pont patent attorney, to Kupperian, of du Pont:
"The Foundation has been merciless in beating out competition
throughout the United States whenever such competition threatened
to encroach upon the synthetic vitamin D field."

Some of the leading manufacturers in the country are licensees
of the Foundation. Many of these manufacturers have
been licensees for years, while in some cases licenses were obtained
by the acquisition of companies holding licenses. Both
du Pont and Standard Brands obtained their licenses by the
latter method.

Acetol Products, Inc., had a license from the Foundation
dated November 15, 1929. Du Pont acquired the assets of
Acetol and on April 30, 1935, Acetol assigned its license to du
Pont. On November 15, 1935, a new agreement was executed
between the Foundation and du Pont which superseded the
Acetol agreement of November 15, 1929.

Standard Brands succeeded to the rights of the Fleischmann
Company under an agreement dated August 8, 1928.

The question naturally arises why these powerful manufacturers
paid the Foundation such large royalties on the basis of
the weak and limited Steenbock patents. The correspondence
indicates that the licensees were not only willing but anxious
to pay the royalties in return for the profit opportunities offered
under the Foundation's schemes.

The desire of the licensees to cooperate in the Foundation's
promotional schemes is well expressed in a letter dated July 8,
1935, from Atkins of du Pont to Barney, the Foundation's
business manager:

"The writer feels certain that you understand our desire and
willingness to be considered as a part of the Foundation. You
know our desire to prevent the Vitamin D field from falling into
disrepute because of too many producers of various types of so-called
Vitamin D. We would much prefer centralized control
in the hands of the Foundation and you may count on us to support
you even though, at times, we may have differences of
opinion."

A memorandum dated January 25, 1937, from H. W. Elley,
associate chemical director of du Pont, to a number of the executives
of du Pont, explains the reason for centralizing "control
in the hands of the Foundation":

"He [Mr. Protto, assistant general manager of du Pont]
felt that it would be preferable to deal with the Wisconsin
Alumni Foundation since they could be of considerable value to
the industry in policing and regulating matters. If, for any
reason such arrangements become unnecessary, it would then be
possible to consider alternative procedures not involving the
use of the Foundation patents, that is, we might commercialize
the Milas process."

The Foundation is organized along the lines of an international
cartel insofar as its licensing program is concerned. It is
party to agreements with the omnipresent I. G. Farbenindustrie
of Germany and Joseph Nathan & Co., of Britain. The agreements,
following the standard cartel pattern, create exclusive
noncompetitive territories. Nathan and I. G. are prohibited
from exporting to the United States and the domestic
licensees of the Foundation are prohibited from exporting to
Germany or Great Britain.

The domestic licensing policy of the Foundation is characterized
by a most complex and minute division of fields into noncompetitive
areas. Generally speaking, these fields of activity
are made exclusive so that all competition between the different
licensees or groups of licensees is eliminated. Provisions of
the various agreements, which will be later described, prevent
any substantial overlapping of these fields. Often the provisions
merely prohibit the licensee from accurately describing his
product but the essential object, elimination of competition, is
attained.

Fields are divided along three distinct lines: (a) the product
to be activated, (b) the method of activation, and (c) the use
of the activated product. In the first category there are 13
principal divisions: (1) the pharmaceutical licensees are permitted
to activate ergosterol, (2) Standard Brands is licensed
to activate yeast and yeast products, (3) du Pont is allowed to
activate ergosterol cholesterol and other sterols except yeast and
yeast products, (4) S. S. Kovaks is allowed to activate sterols
derived from yeasts but not yeast, (5) a group of licensees are
permitted to activate evaporated milk, (6) a number of licensees
are permitted to activate fluid milk, (7) Quaker Oats is allowed
to activate cereals, (8) Borden is allowed to activate a milk
product known as Dryco, (9) The Wanter Company is allowed
to activate Ovaltine, (10) the Commander Larrabee Company
is allowed to activate flour, (11) R. B. Davis and Company is
allowed to activate Cocomalt, (12) Loose-Wiles Biscuit Company
is allowed to activate crackers, and (13) Ayerst, McKenna
and Harrison are allowed to activate a food product known as
Glucose-D.

The extent to which the division of fields is carried is exemplified
in an agreement dated June 27, 1938, between the Foundation
and the Loose-Wiles Biscuit Company. This agreement
authorizes Loose-Wiles to activate "Graham Crackers" and
"Wafers slightly sweetened to such as English Style Arrowroot
Wafers," but does not permit the activation of "cakes" and
"cookies."

According to the method of activation, fields are divided into
direct irradiation and activation by the introduction of an irradiated
substance. Some few licensees are permitted to use either
method of activation, but most are restricted to a single method.
One of the most curious licenses issued by the Foundation permits
the activation of milk by feeding cows irradiated material.

The division of fields according to use is most detailed, but
can be broken into several general classes. Licenses are issued
for the human medicine field, for the human food field, for the
fluid milk field, for the evaporated milk field, for the animal
feed field, and for a field in which the product is not intended
for internal use.

At the outset, it was pointed out that the stated objectives of
the Foundation are "to protect the public" and "to prevent unscrupulous
commercialization." Over the years the Foundation's
devotion to these objectives appears to have wavered,
The Foundation appears to be primarily interested in royalties,
with little or no regard for the public interest. Article VII of
the agreement of November 1, 1938, with the milk companies
states that if "it should be found that the activation of unsweetened
evaporated milk by ultra violet rays under this
license is substantially harmful to the user of such milk, or to
the milk itself, the licensee shall have the right to cancel this
license."

In a memorandum dated February 8, 1939, Dr. Russell described
a similar position of the Foundation in regard to high
dosages of Vitamin D: "Steenbock is of the opinion that in view
of the fact that Vitamin D is no longer a distinctive Steenbock
product but can be secured from a variety of sources that the
Foundation might as well favor the commercialization of high
dosages unless there is <i>very</i> serious objection on the part of the
A.M.A. officials toward a move of this sort."

It is to be noted that in neither of these cases is the Foundation
concerned with public benefit or medical approval, but only
with <i>substantial harm</i> and a <i>very serious medical objection</i>.

Another instance of the Foundation's regard for the public
interest was the Snider Packing Company matter. In 1931 the
Snider Packing Company obtained irradiated yeast from
Fleischmann to add to Snider's tomato juice. The results were
apparently not too satisfactory. After this 1931 failure, Snider
was persuaded to continue the license and the Foundation undertook
to supervise the activation of the tomato juice. Steenbock
and Scott recommended Acetol irradiated ergosterol and
this recommendation was followed.

Despite the recommendations and supervision and guarantees
of the Foundation, the Vitamin D content of the Snider tomato
juice did not come up to expectations. This inadequacy was
known to Snider, Acetol, and the Foundation, and on February
27, 1933, Russell wrote to Acetol stating:

"It would be most unfortunate if any publicity was to occur
as a result of the reduced potency of the Snider product and it
would not only ruin the Snider business in this product, but
would affect most disastrously you as well as ourselves. If the
Government were to discover this situation and publish the result,
it would do irreparable injury to the whole Vitamin D
situation in foods."

The correspondence does not show whether any of the Snider
products reached the market under false labels, but the Foundation's
concern in the matter is clear. The Foundation feared
only publicity or discovery by the Government.

In 1934 and 1935 some research workers, and especially
Dr. Reed of the University of Illinois, found that large doses
of Vitamin D were highly beneficial in severe cases of asthma,
hayfever and arthritis. These large doses required a highly
concentrated product which was most easily used in the form of
gelatin capsules. The Foundation and its licensees were greatly
interested in this project, but feared the effect this concentrate
might have on the pricing structure of viosterol. These
fears and a suggested solution are referred to in a report of a
conference between Russell and Ross of the Foundation and
Nielsen of Abbott, held early in February 1935. This report,
signed by Nielsen, states:

"Mr. Nielsen stated that if the capsules were priced considerably
lower than the commercial product unit for unit, nothing
would prevent the hospitals from opening the capsules and
diluting the content with vegetable oil to obtain a '250D' solution
far below the regular cost.

"Dean Russell asked for suggestions to prevent this. Mr.
Nielsen stated that Abbott Laboratories would give further
thought to this problem. Tentatively, he suggested that the
concentrate might be denatured by the addition of a drug also
indicated in these cases--Ephedrine, for example--that the
product be considered as a drug, not a vitamin, and that it be
distributed for clinical trial under a special name--all provided
that the licensees agree. <i>Any untoward effects from it thus
would not reflect on the Viosterol products on the market.</i>"

Despite its lofty objectives, the licensing program of the
Foundation appears to have resulted actually in a substantial
reduction of research and development. Its attitude toward
research is indicated in a letter from Russell to the licensees
dated August 24, 1936:

"We are hardly interested in the prosecution of problems of
a purely scientific character that come to us from outside institutions.
Nevertheless, if this is a problem that has definite commercial
possibilities, we should not make a hasty adverse decision."

In a letter dated January 6, 1937, addressed to Elley of
duPont, Waddell of duPont referred to a meeting in Madison
with members of the Foundation and stated:

"He [Steenbock] mentioned that most of the pharmaceutical
licensees had not been interested in obtaining rights to the manufacture
of crystalline Vitamin D (from ergosterol) and that
the present situation might find them in the same attitude. He
admitted, however, that if the patent situation and licensing
arrangements worked out so that the five pharmaceutical companies
were again in a position of having an exclusive hold on
the synthetic Vitamin D field that undoubtedly they would be
very much interested."

Thus, in spite of the acknowledged physiological superiority
of Vitamin D_{3}, the Foundation was reluctant to do any research
whatever unless the willingness and cooperation of the
licensees showed a definite promise of substantial profits.

The effect of the licensing policy on the research activities of
licensees is explained in a letter from Kupperian of Acetol to
Waddell, research director of Acetol. This letter states:

"According to my reading of the contract with Wisconsin
Alumni Research Foundation, we are not at liberty to use yeast
in connection with irradiated ergosterol, this field being reserved
exclusively to Fleischmann. In view of this fact, I think we
ought not to waste time and money on experiments in connection
with yeast."

In at least one case where the Foundation sponsored and
financed research, the publication of the results of the research
were suppressed by the Foundation because they were at variance
with the Foundation's commercial interests. In an attempt
to eliminate the non-infringing product of General Mills from
competition with the Viosterol of the pharmaceutical licensees,
the Foundation attempted to prove that Viosterol was clinically
superior to the General Mills product. To accomplish this, the
Foundation made a grant to Drs. Smith and Owens of Freedmen's
Hospital in Washington, D. C., to run certain tests comparing
the effectiveness of the General Mills product and Viosterol,
and to prepare an article for the medical journals on the
results. On June 17, 1936, Drs. Smith and Owens submitted
to the Foundation their article, which contains the following
conclusion:

"A comparative study of nine cases of varying degrees of
rickets receiving 800 U.S.P. units of Squibb's Viosterol daily
with eleven comparable cases receiving 800 U.S.P. units of
American Pharmaceutical Company Viosterol [General Mills'
product] shows no significant difference in rate or degree of
healing as determined (1) by X-ray of the wrists and (3) Ca
and P determination on the blood."

The attitude of the Foundation and its licensees to this article
is described in a letter from Lescohier of Parke-Davis to Anderson
of Squibb, dated July 6, 1936:

"If this article is published the Steenbock group are certainly
in the position of being hung with their own rope. I should like
to see the publication suppressed but am pretty certain that
Meade Johnson will see that it is published since they are no
longer vitally interested in Viosterol. Certainly anything that
can be done to delay publication would be advisable."

In a letter dated August 17, 1936, Scott of the Foundation
expressed the Foundation's attitude on this article as follows:

"From the outset, of course, we have been opposed to publication
of this paper in any form. We have advised Dr. Smith
that it was necessary to get the opinions of the pharmaceutical
committee, and we intend to confer with them in the near future
advising them that publication of the work is not desirable."

The Foundation has also suppressed the use of competing
patents. Article II of the Supplemental Agreement of June 3,
1937, between the Foundation and Meade Johnson, Squibb,
Parke-Davis, and Abbott provides for the licensing of additional
pharmaceutical manufacturers who had been using Sperti Patent
No. 1,676,579 on the irradiation of pharmaceutical products.
This section provides:

"It is understood and agreed that such additional Licensees
shall be prohibited, by appropriate restrictions in any license
agreements that may be entered into between the Licensor and
such additional Licensees, from employing the process described
and claimed in United States Letters Patent No. 1,676,579 to
George Sperti and from advertising the use of said process in
connection with products sold under said license agreements...."

Thus, the results of the Foundation's licensing program have
been to stifle its own research activities and the research activities
of its licensees, to prevent the publication of information
which might jeopardize the Foundation's financial interests, and
to suppress competing patents. Certainly, these are peculiar
results of a program instituted "to protect the public" and "to
prevent unscrupulous commercialism."

One of the most important fields in the Foundation's scheme
of exploitation is the pharmaceutical field. All Vitamin D products
used in the treatment or prevention of human ills are embraced
within the pharmaceutical field, and restrictions in this
field thus have a direct and immediate effect on the health
and well-being of the general public. Also, at the time the
Foundation embarked on its licensing program, the pharmaceutical
field probably was one of the most promising, both from
a publicity and a profit standpoint.

In or about March 1929, the Foundation made agreements
with five licensees, all manufacturers of pharmaceuticals: Meade
Johnson & Co., Winthrop Chemical Company, Abbott Laboratories,
Parke-Davis & Company, and E. R. Squibb & Sons.
These agreements have been amended several times by letter
agreements and supplemental agreements. Two letters, dated
March 20, 1939 and April 27, 1939, offer the licensees certain
royalty reductions, and it is assumed that these reductions were
accepted. These letters do not, however, make any substantial
changes in the restrictive provisions of the agreement.

This combination in restraint of trade between the Foundation
and its licensees is expressed in various ways throughout
the pharmaceutical licenses. For example, Article XII of the
agreement of March 21, 1929, fixed minimum prices for the
sale of irradiated pharmaceutical products. This article contains
the following language: "Such prices so established shall remain
in effect indefinitely but may be changed by the Licensor not
less than ninety (90) days after consultation with all of the
Licensees of this group."

Article XIII of the agreement of March 21, 1939, states
that the potencies of the pharmaceutical products shall remain
fixed "until and unless changed by the mutual understanding
of a majority of the licensees of this group." Article XVII
prevents the assignment of the licenses "without the written
consent of the Licensor, the Patentee and the Licensees under
similar licenses." Each of the agreements with Abbott, Meade
Johnson, Squibb and Parke-Davis, executed June 3, 1937, also
contains long recitals regarding the provisions to be introduced
into a new contract with Winthrop Chemical Co., Inc.

Price stabilization was one of the main considerations offered
by the Foundation to its licensees in exchange for the royalties.
It might almost be said that this price stabilization was the bait
which made the licensing scheme of the Foundation so attractive
to the various manufacturers. Clough of Abbott wrote to
Russell of the Foundation on April 21, 1936, and referred to
the importance of price-fixing activities of the Foundation as
follows: "It was argued by your Trustees that under our arrangement
with the Foundation, we were given certain benefits
of price stabilization which was well worth the additional 5%."

That price-fixing was one of the most important points in the
pharmaceutical licensing plan and is described in a memorandum
of a conference between Anderson and Lewis of Squibb
and Ross and Barney of the Foundation on February 23, 1939:

"We outlined the high potency D situation both with respect
to Merrell and Winthrop. Their reaction was first that Squibb
would have no objection to Merrell's continuing to sell its concentrated
viosterol if we could line up Merrell on its regular
viosterol from the standpoint of container size and price. We
indicated that this latter could be accomplished."

Further, the papers indicate that this price-fixing was carried
over into the field of resale prices. This is brought out in a
letter from R. D. Keim of Squibb to Dean Russell of the
Foundation dated July 23, 1934:

"We gave this matter our very serious consideration and
wrote to all the licensees, under date of July 19, 1934, as per
copy enclosed and we firmly believe that our suggested <i>Full
Retail Prices per package to the consumer and Minimum Retail
Prices per package to the consumer</i> for Viosterol in Oil and Cod
Liver Oil with Viosterol are more in line with present market
trends and the present economic market conditions than those
proposed by Parke-Davis & Company.

"We are desirous of acting in harmony with all the other
licensees of the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation in regard
to the stabilization of the market for Viosterol in Oil and
Cod Liver Oil with Viosterol. However, we firmly believe that
it is necessary to establish a schedule of Minimum Retail Prices
to the consumer such as we have suggested in order to bring
about such stabilization."

Prices were not only fixed; they were fixed arbitrarily at levels
which can only be regarded as extortionate in view of the
economic status of the people whose need for Vitamin D was
the greatest. (Barney, the business manager of the Foundation,
once stated on examination in a lawsuit: "It is my understanding
that rickets is found to a great extent in the so-called
poorer class of people.") Despite this full awareness of the
incidence of their high price policy, the Foundation and its
licensees remorselessly maintained prices on the Viosterol products
so high that their use was practically restricted to those
who had least need for them. This is recognized in a letter
dated March 30, 1934, from Russell to the pharmaceutical
licensees: "Very severe criticism from certain prominent pediatricians
has been lodged against the Foundation on account of
the alleged high retail prices of certain Vitamin D preparations."

The price-fixing activities of the Foundation also extended to
sales to Federal, State and local governments and government
agencies. On May 10, 1940, W. S. Merrell Company wrote
to the Foundation:

"We have an inquiry from the Government for a substantial
quantity of Irradiated Ergosterol and are wondering if we shall
have to abide by the price schedule in our license agreement in
quoting. In other words, would our quotation have to be the
same as our minimum price to wholesalers, or could we figure
on a reasonable profit basis taking our cost on such a large quantity
for one shipment into consideration?"

The letter also contained a postscript: "We know that the
price would have to be much lower than our price to the wholesalers
to secure the order." In spite of the fact that Merrell
was merely asking to quote on a "reasonable profit basis" and
assured the Foundation that the price would have to be "much
lower ... to secure the order," the business manager of Foundation
replied on May 13, 1940:

"Under the present license agreement with your company
and the other pharmaceutical licensees of the Foundation under
the Steenbock patents, the minimum price to be quoted to government
institutions is the minimum wholesale price as outlined
in your contract, less two per cent discount for cash if paid by
the tenth of the following month.

"All of the other pharmaceutical licenses of the Foundation
have operated under this arrangement for some time. We note,
however, your postscript which indicates that the quotation to
the government will have to be lower than the price to wholesalers
in order to secure the order. We dislike to see your
company or any of our other licensees lose business."

The pharmaceutical agreements fix both the potency and the
quantities in which Vitamin D concentrates may be sold by the
pharmaceutical licensees. The purpose and effect of these additional
controls were stated by an official of the Foundation. "We
feel that it is perfectly proper to control the price of Viosterol
and cod liver oil from a legal standpoint and, unless we control
the potency of the product and size of the container, price control
of the product, of course, would be rather useless."

The pharmaceutical agreements specified that potencies could
be changed only by "mutual agreement of Licensees of this
group," while container sizes could be changed by "mutual understanding
of a majority of the Licensees of this group." Operations
were in exact accord with these provisions, and only
unanimous approval by the licensees could authorize potency
changes. Notes of a phone conversation of March 30, 1932, between
Nielsen of Meade Johnson and Russell of the Foundation
state: "Russell said under no condition could such approval be
given. That Meade Johnson had no warrant in changing the
potency without the knowledge and approval and consent, not
only of the Foundation but also of the other four licensees."

Prior to December 24, 1936, the Foundation and its pharmaceutical
licensees maintained a very effective black list and
white list of dealers. While the approval of dealers was ostensibly
within the exclusive control of the Foundation, actually
it was again a matter for vote by the licensees. L. D.
Barney, business manager of the Foundation, described the program
to Dr. Russell, director of the Foundation, in a memorandum
dated November 6, 1935:

"As you know, the usual procedure in handling requests of
wholesale drug concerns with respect to their addition to the
approved wholesale list for the sale of Viosterol products is for
the Foundation to send the name and address of this company
to the five licensees. They, in turn, investigate the company and
report back to whether or not they favor the addition of the
said company to the list. The general procedure set up several
years ago was that a majority of the licensees (three) would
constitute sufficient authority on the part of the Foundation to
add the name of the company to the approved list.

"By reason of the manner in which these are handled, it is
impossible for us to tell the licensee when we refuse their request
anything other than the fact that the Committee, which
handles the request, did not approve their application, or, stated
in another way, the Committee voted in the negative. Obviously,
we cannot say that our licensees did not favor the addition
of this company to the group."

W. N. Larson of Meade Johnson recognized that this black
list and white list might be illegal, and referred to it in a letter
dated December 22, 1936, to Ward Ross, Counsel for the
Foundation. He sent copies to each of the other pharmaceutical
licensees. Larson's letter states:

"We would have no objection to the Foundation acting as a
clearing house for information relative to those to whom wholesale
terms on Viosterol and Cod Liver Oil with Viosterol are
extended, except we wonder if such action might not be construed
as a violation of law. Anyone investigating this activity
might well inquire as to why this was done, if some action
which could be construed as collusion or restraint of trade were
not contemplated."

One of the principal functions of the black listing and white
listing of wholesalers and retailers was the maintenance of resale
prices. This is explained in a letter dated June 29, 1931, from
W. N. Larson of Meade Johnson to N. A. Buttle of Winthrop,
with copies to the other licensees and to the Foundation. This
letter states:

"To our knowledge there have been very few departures
from the suggested minimum price, and these departures have
been confined to a very few relatively unimportant wholesale
druggists whose objectives unlike ours, are not to stabilize conditions
in the drug trade. It is the legal right of any manufacturer
to refuse to sell to a wholesaler or any other customer in
fact, who will not carry out his wishes. I hope that it will not be
necessary, but it is entirely possible that it may become desirable
for the Foundation to make the list of preferred jobbers a
trifle more exclusive than it is at the present time. We would
work with the Foundation in any reasonable steps in that direction.
Better proof of our desire to have this matter straightened
out could hardly be given, we believe."

At least as early as 1933, the Foundation and the pharmaceutical
licensees realized that this black list was illegal. On
May 11, 1933, Larson of Meade Johnson wrote to Gunn, attorney
for the Foundation, regarding this black list:

"Licensees cannot make agreements among themselves in
these matters and must, of course, take the position that they
are acting under instructions from the Wisconsin Alumni Research
Foundation. The revelation that that is not the case
might prove to be very embarrassing, as you probably realize.
My suggestion is that, in cases of this kind, you simply inform
the inquiring party that your action was guided by a committee,
operating under the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation,
and that this committee does not reveal its reasons for taking
any action of this kind."

Probably in part on account of this growing disquietude concerning
the lawfulness of their undercover boycott, in part also,
perhaps, because of the vast amount of detail work involved in
maintaining the list, the Foundation ceased rendering this service
for its licensees some time late in 1936. On December 24,
1936, the business manager of the Foundation referred a prospective
wholesaler to the pharmaceutical licensees for direct
action.

The pharmaceutical agreements were thus far more than
mere restrictive patent licenses. Prices, potencies, dosages and
container sizes were fixed by the licensees jointly and black lists
of price-cutting dealers were established and maintained. The
Foundation offered little more than a facade of respectability to
conceal these activities, and it was for this concealment that the
licensees were willing to pay so handsomely.

The remaining agreements of the Foundation prohibit the
other licensees from invading the pharmaceutical field. Several
of the agreements prohibit, in express terms, sales of activated
products for pharmaceutical uses, others so limit the potency of
the licensed product as to make it worthless for medicinal purposes,
while still others merely limit the right of the licensee
to claim curative properties for his product in his advertising.

All the agreements of the Foundation clearly show the intention
to protect the exclusive market of the pharmaceutical
licensees in the human medicine field. Actually this practice is
carried to a ridiculous extent. The following statement appears
in a memo note of November 14, 1935, written by Ward Ross,
General Counsel for the Foundation, regarding a conference
with Dr. Hooper of Winthrop:

"With regard to the comparison between Viosterol and Drisdol,
I asked Hooper how he would like it if our milk licensees
said that one quart of irradiated milk was equal to 10 drops of
Viosterol. Hooper claimed that this would be an invasion of
the pharmaceutical field by our milk licensees and that they
would be selling milk as medicine."

Apparently, the licensees are prevented from telling the
truthful merits of their products if the truth would cause an
overlapping of the artificial division of fields.

Another industry capable of using large quantities of Vitamin
D was the bread industry. Under an agreement dated November
15, 1939, this field is allocated exclusively to duPont. DuPont's
chief concern in the bread field was price "stabilization"
which to duPont meant the maintenance of high price levels.
DuPont was even willing to share the field with Standard
Brands to accomplish this end. A memorandum, dated September
19, 1935, from Mr. Kenneth T. King of duPont to
Mr. Ralph Horton and Mr. W. S. Kies, a Trustee of the
Foundation, states: "We would be willing for the Foundation
to grant non-exclusive license for the sale of Vitamin D from
Ergosterol in the bread field to the Fleischmann Company, providing
the price of Vitamin D in the bread field shall be stabilized."
The agreement between duPont and the Foundation
expressly stipulates the limits of licensees' discretion in price
policy. Article 2 (C) provides: "DuPont shall not sell said
irradiated or activated Ergosterol or its derivatives at a higher
price than one dollar and a half ($1.50) or a lower price than
ninety-five cents ($.95) per million U.S.P.A. (revised 1934)
Vitamin D Units.

The Foundation's support of duPont's policy of high prices
is indicated in a letter dated July 18, 1935, from Barney to Atkins
of duPont which states: "Dr. Waddell stated that it was
his opinion that if General Baking came back into the picture a
higher price for ergosterol should be charged. We discussed
the possibility of a price of $1.25 to $1.50 per million Steenbock
units."

So long as the Foundation could be "merciless in beating out
competition" price-fixing at these levels was quite attractive.
But by 1940 the weakness of the Steenbock patents was so apparent
that the fixed prices became a competitive hazard. On
March 5, 1940, King of duPont wrote to the business manager
of the Foundation:

"In reply to your letter of February 24th we are very much
interested in modifying our contract with respect to the maximum
and minimum provisions in the baking field. In fact, we
believe the simplest way to handle this question is to delete
from our present contract the clause specifying maximum and
minimum provisions. This, of course, was explained to you over
the telephone in our recent conversation concerning General
Baking. I believe unless some change is made in the maximum
and minimum provisions all business in this field will be lost
by the licensees of the Foundation."

The Foundation recognized the need for abandoning these
artificially high price levels and on March 14, 1940, Barney of
the Foundation wrote to King of duPont referring to "a quotation
from General Mills at a price of 60c per million" and
stated: "This will acknowledge receipt of your letter of March
5th regarding the maximum and minimum price provisions with
respect to the baking field. Shortly, Ward [Ross of the Foundation]
will send Art [Connolly of duPont] either a letter
agreement or supplemental contract deleting this provision
from the contract." On July 19, 1940, Connolly wrote Ross
again asking elimination of the price-fixing provision and finally
on July 30, 1940, Ross of the Foundation wrote to duPont deleting
the price-fixing paragraph from Article 2 (C) of the
agreement.

DuPont's aim in all of its Vitamin D operations was to obtain
high, non-competitive prices for its products. This thought
is expressed time and time again. A memorandum dated July
26, 1932, from Bradshaw to Atkins, both of Acetol, states:
"This morning I reported to Mr. Protto and Mr. Robinson regarding
conversation with Dean Russell and also the known
facts concerning Lever Bros. business. It was Mr. Protto's feeling
that we should raise our prices as much as possible and not
sell the material cheap." The next day Atkins replied:

"It seems obvious to me that we should always try to get
the maximum price for any of our goods, keeping in mind the
possible potential volume and competitive conditions.

"According to authentic price information which we have
secured, Fleischmann have been selling and offering Vitamin D
at slightly less than $1.00 per 1,000,000 Steenbock Rat Units.
This is what influenced my suggested price of $1.00 to Lever
Brothers and I was very much surprised when you informed me
that Fleischmann was not in a position to furnish irradiated ergosterol.
If this were true, I apparently had gone too low on
our initial price in view of the fact that we were the exclusive
source of supply."

The profit levels resulting from the Foundation's activities
were enormous. In a letter dated March 9, 1938, addressed to
Ward Ross of the Foundation, King of duPont stated: "With
respect to the Chesney matter, all I know is that 35c per million
units was quoted to General Baking Company."

Vitamin D is of the greatest importance to expectant and nursing
mothers, infants, and children and, consequently, milk is
one of the most natural and most important vehicles for this
vitamin. The Council on Foods of the American Medical Association
stated in the <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i>
for January 16, 1937, "Of all the common foods available,
milk is most suitable as a carrier of added Vitamin D. Vitamin
D is concerned with the utilization of calcium and phosphorous
of which milk is an excellent source." Next to the pharmaceutical
industry, milk was probably the most promising outlet for
Vitamin D from a profit standpoint. The Foundation therefore
became active in promoting the use of Vitamin D in the milk
industry.

On November 1, 1938, the Foundation granted licenses to
five producers of evaporated milk, The Borden Company, Carnation
Company, Indiana Condensed Milk Company, Nestle's
Milk Products, Inc., and Pet Milk Company, to activate evaporated
milk. The agreements allocate the evaporated milk
field exclusively to these five producers. Like the Foundation's
other agreements, these evaporated milk agreements provide
for the maintenance of the division of fields. Article XX, in
protecting the evaporated milk field, states: "The Licensor
agrees that in all licenses for the activation of fluid milk by the
use of irradiated ergosterol or by direct application of ultra
violet rays, it will incorporate a provision preventing the use or
sale of such activated milk by such licensees for the manufacture
of activated unsweetened evaporated milk."

The rights of the evaporated milk producers were similarly
restricted to prevent encroachment on other exclusive fields.
Article XII specifically protects the pharmaceutical field by
providing that "said evaporated milk shall not be intended or
sold as a cure for rickets." The other fields of use of Vitamin D
are protected from invasion by activated evaporated milk by
Article IX which provides: "The Licensee agrees that it will
not knowingly directly or indirectly sell its unsweetened evaporated
milk activated under this license to others ... as a source
of Vitamin D for any other product when such product is intended
to be sold or resold on a commercial basis."

There are several methods by which fluid milk may be activated
and the Foundation has issued licenses for each of these
methods. In one method, irradiated yeast is fed to cows to increase
the Vitamin D content of the milk; in the second method,
the milk is irradiated directly; and in the third method, an
activated concentrate is introduced into the milk.

The Bill of Particulars in the Vitamin Technologists suit lists
138 dairies licensed to activate milk by feeding irradiated yeast
to cows. In its agreement with West Haven Creamery, Inc.,
which is typical of all of the licensees of this class, the Foundation
licensed and empowered the licensee to purchase from
Standard Brands, Incorporated, dried yeast "antirachitically activated"
upon the following terms and conditions:

"First: The Licensee shall buy and use such yeast for no
other purpose than that of feeding cows to impart antirachitic
qualities to milk.

<tb>

"Fourth: The Licensee shall not sell any of its antirachitically
activated milk to others for use or incorporation in any other
marketed product when Vitamin D or antirachitic claims are
made or intended to be made for such other marketed product.

"Fifth: The activated yeast purchased by Licensee pursuant
to this License shall not be resold or otherwise used except for
feeding the same to the Licensee's animals, pursuant to the conditions
of this license."

The Steenbock patents do not even purport to cover anything
more than a process of irradiating or an irradiated product.
Under no circumstances could the milk from an irradiated-yeast-fed
cow be an infringement of the Steenbock patents.
Article Fourth is a bare-faced attempt to carry out the artificial
division of fields. Milk from an irradiated-yeast-fed cow could,
for example, be used in the commercial making of bread, but
such use would be an invasion of the exclusive bread and bread-*stuffs
field. It was, therefore, necessary for the Foundation to
insert this limitation in the West Haven Creamery's license
even though the limitation was entirely outside the Steenbock
patents.

The prohibition of resale in Article Fifth likewise lacks any
taint of legal justification. A patentee's right under a patent is
completely exhausted by the first sale of the patented product.
Here again the Foundation is seeking to prevent any use of the
irradiated yeast which may in any way conflict with the division
of fields.

As the demand for activated milk increased, the addition of
concentrates was accepted by the medical profession. This business
was so attractive that the Foundation decided to engage in
the sale of these concentrates for addition to milk. The Foundation
did not, however, wish to enter a market in which any
competition existed and since Standard Brands had rights in
this field, it was essential that the Standard Brands competition
be eliminated. In the agreement of February 1, 1939, the
Foundation agreed to pay Standard Brands 40% of the profits
derived by the Foundation from the sale of concentrates in
return for Standard Brands' withdrawal and agreement not to,
compete.

Vitamin D is of the utmost importance in the poultry industry
since it is essential for the prevention and cure of rickets and
for bone development, egg production and hatchability. Prior
to the war some Vitamin D could be obtained from cod and
other fish liver oils, but at the present time, the requirements
must be obtained almost exclusively from synthetic Vitamin D.
Even apart from war time shortages, synthetic Vitamin D presents
certain advantages over fish liver oils. The synthetic product
may be used for forced feeding without adversely affecting
the flavor of the poultry, while too generous use of fish liver
oils results in a somewhat fishy flavor.

The size of the poultry market in the United States involves
almost astronomical figures. The crop report of September 1,
1943 of the United States Department of Agriculture on poultry
and egg production states that there were over 316,000,000
laying hens; over 318,000,000 pullets and over 224,000,000
chicks. The egg production for August 1943 was 3,863,000,000.
This crop report also states that the average cost of feed
for farm poultry ration on August 15, 1943 was $2.13 per
hundred pounds. Dr. Harry Titus of the Poultry Nutrition
Section of the Bureau of Animal Industries of the Department
of Agriculture estimates that 25,000,000 tons of commercial
mixed feed are used annually in the poultry industry and that
75% of this feed is fortified with Vitamin D.

The wartime demands on meat make the poultry market unusually
important and any artificial restraints or artificial price
levels affecting the poultry market are of the most serious national
importance.

The discovery upon which Steenbock's patent No. 1680818
is based is that certain substances, known as pro-vitamins take
on antirachitic properties when irradiated with ultra violet light.
These pro-vitamins are sterols which may be obtained from
either vegetable or animal sources and the effectiveness of the
irradiated product is dependent upon the nature of the pro-vitamin.

In the early days, vegetable pro-vitamins were used almost
exclusively but it was subsequently found that the animal pro-vitamins
were superior. Vegetable pro-vitamins were unsuitable
for poultry feeding and the exploitation of this market
awaited the development of the animal pro-vitamins, cholesterol
and 7-dehydrocholesterol.

The animal and poultry feed field had been exclusively allocated
to duPont and its predecessor, Acetol. This exclusive arrangement
highlights the artificial nature of the Foundation's
division of fields. In the case of cows Vitamin D in the feed will
result in a Vitamin D content in the milk. Vitamin D may also
have some antirachitic effect on the cow itself. In interpreting
this provision of its agreement with the Foundation, duPont
was obliged to consider the question whether the effect of the
Vitamin D feed is in the cow or in the milk. Finally, however,
duPont resolved the doubt in its own favor. A letter dated
February 20, 1935, addressed to Kupperian of duPont, from
Connolly, a duPont attorney, states: "Irradiated cholesterol
may therefore be used in feed for cows regardless of whether
its purpose is to enhance the Vitamin D content of the milk
or prevent rickets in the cow itself."

Prior to 1936, duPont recognized the importance of the
animal sterols, cholesterol and 7-dehydrocholesterol, in the
poultry feed field. DuPont immediately set out to secure a
monopoly over these pro-vitamins and through them to control
the entire poultry feed field. The first step in this direction is
described in a letter dated January 21, 1936 from King of
duPont to Nielsen of Abbott which states:

"We were, of course, largely interested in the poultry field,
and to protect our position had made tentative arrangements to
secure all of the available cholesterol in the country, or perhaps
we might say, in the world."

Apart from attempting to corner the sources of animal sterols,
duPont also sought exclusive rights in the field of animal sterols
within the licensing scheme of the Foundation. The agreement
of November 15, 1935 between the Foundation and duPont
grants duPont an exclusive license to irradiate sterols from animal
sources. When the Foundation wished to grant new licenses
and submitted the proposed licenses to duPont for approval,
duPont insisted upon retaining exclusive rights in the animal
pro-vitamin field. In a report to the Executive Committee of
duPont recommending approval of the Foundation's license to
Merrell, E. G. Robinson states:

"The Foundation now wishes to grant a license to the William
S. Merrell Company of Cincinnati, Ohio, limited to Vitamin
D from non-animal sources for sale only as medicinals or
pharmaceuticals for human use, which this department is willing
to approve. It is limited to non-animal sources in the pharmaceutical
field and, therefore, we do not think it will materially
interfere with our own developments. Also, the Foundation
is able to grant a license with respect to yeast ergosterol without
our permission, since that product is not in our license field;
and if the license to Merrell is limited to yeast we will not have
the opportunity of selling Merrell our own ergosterol."

Thus, while duPont desired to protect its animal sterol field
it did not wish the Merrell license so limited as to deprive
duPont of a potential market for non-yeast ergosterol. In both
instances the Foundation was most willing to cooperate.

<i>Quebracho Extract</i>


Quebracho extract is of great use to the nation in the war
effort. It is a material which has been found most desirable
for tanning the leather which goes into the shoes, harness,
straps and other leather articles of the armed forces. It is of
some interest to every man, woman and child whose ration
stamps are used to buy a pair of shoes.

Practically all heavy leather tanned in this country has been
tanned by use of a blend in which this material is an important
ingredient. It comes from the southern part of South America,
and there have been times when it was difficult, and others when
it appeared it might be impossible, to ship the material to this
country. The production and sale of the material is controlled
by a monopoly pool or cartel, and this country is at the mercy
of the pool in procuring the material in adequate quantities
and at a reasonable price. The pool has exercised its power to
curtail the quantity shipped to this country, to prevent any adequate
stock pile in this country, and to raise prices out of proportion
to any increase in costs.

In the Spring of 1942 the Department of Justice submitted
the facts of this monopoly pool to a Federal Grand Jury in
New York, and it promptly returned an indictment against five
American corporations, one Canadian and one British corporation,
and five individuals, officials of four of the American corporations.
Pleas of <i>nolo contendere</i> were subsequently entered
by three of the American corporations and four of their officials.
Fines were levied against and paid by these defendants, totalling
$59,002. A <i>nolle prosequi</i> was entered as to the two
remaining American corporations, the two British corporations,
and one official. The reason for the <i>nolle prosequi</i> in the case
of the two foreign corporations was that they were outside the
jurisdiction of the court.

The national interest in such a situation plainly warranted a
diligent effort long ago to find an adequate substitute which
would relieve us from entire dependence upon the ability and
willingness of a foreign cartel to supply us with a vital material.

The extract is obtained from the quebracho tree. For commercial
purposes the growth of these trees is limited to Argentina
and Paraguay. Although there are quebracho forests in
southern Brazil, the extract manufactured from these trees is
inferior to Argentine and Paraguayan extract, and cannot compete
favorably with it in the market. Ninety-eight per cent of
the world production of quebracho wood and extract comes
from Argentina and Paraguay. In 1942 the total production
amounted to approximately 300,000 metric tons of extract and
was valued at $25,000,000.

This war has naturally affected the market for quebracho in
Europe. Several years before the war the German Government
took steps to render that country less dependent upon the continuance
of quebracho imports. Clauses were inserted in all
Army and Navy contracts for the purchase of leather goods that
at least 12 per cent of such goods should be tanned by German-manufactured
tanning agents. This resulted in the development
of a new industry based upon the production of tanning material
from German trees. Tannic acid was extracted from the oak
trees of South Germany and was permitted to find a place in
the tanning industry by reason of the Government policy. Thus
the German leather industry gradually became independent of
quebracho importation from South America.

The loss of the continental European market due to the war
was not felt to any great extent by the quebracho exporters because
of the great increase of exports to the United States. During
the war the imports of quebracho almost doubled due to the
tremendous production of leather goods for the armed forces.

The quebracho industry consists of twenty-two producers in
Argentina and Paraguay. Five of these are owned or controlled
by the British corporation, The Forestal Land, Timber and
Railways, Ltd., through its Argentine subsidiary, La Forestal
Argentina S. A. de Tierras, Maderas y Explotaciones Commerciales
e Industriales. These five companies have a productive
capacity which constitutes approximately 57 per cent of the
total capacity.

All producers, except four having a capacity of about eleven
per cent of the entire industry, are members of a Quebracho
Pool which regulates the production and sale of the product.
Quebracho is sold by official agents of the Pool, and it recognizes
two official agents in the United States: The Tannin Corporation
and the International Products Corporation, both of
New York.

Forestal of England controls La Forestal of Argentina
through the ownership of a majority of its stock and a substantial
portion of its bonds. One John B. Sullivan, Chairman of
the Board of Forestal of England, is also the manager of Forestal
of Argentina. Sullivan is an Argentine citizen who was
formerly a citizen of the United States and a graduate of Harvard
College.

By reason of La Forestal's ownership of 57 per cent of the
total productive capacity of quebracho in South America, which
is approximately eight times the capacity of its next largest competitor,
Forestal has completely dominated the quebracho industry.
Its policy has been to restrict production and maintain
high prices. Forestal's economic dominance in Argentina has
enabled it to exert a great influence upon the government of
Argentina. For example, in 1942 the efforts of John B. Sullivan
alone were primarily responsible for the imposition by the
Argentine Minister of Agriculture of highly restrictive export
quotas upon each producer. These restrictions were imposed
upon the industry at a time when it appeared that the efforts of
Forestal to continue similar restrictions upon the South American
producers might fail.

Forestal's domination extends not only over the production
of quebracho, but over its distribution as well, including importation
into this country. Through St. Helen's Ltd., a Canadian
corporation, Forestal of England owns substantially all
of the stock of Tannin Products Corporation, a Delaware corporation,
which in turn owns all the capital stock of The Tannin
Corporation, a New York corporation.

The Tanning Corporation imports approximately 70 per
cent of all quebracho extract consumed in the United States.
The Tannin Corporation has been controlled by Forestal of
England since 1913 and during the past thirty years its controlling
officials have been completely subservient to the policies
of Forestal of England. Thus Forestal controls this material
from the tree to the United States consumer.

The questionable character of the functioning of these American
subsidiaries is indicated by portions of a letter written De-*


*cember 23, 1941, by Carl B. Ely, President of the Tannin
Corporation, to J. B. Sullivan of Forestal, whom he addressed
as "My dear Jack":

"You will recall the formation for good and practical reasons
of the Tannin Products Corporation in 1925, at which time a
very large dividend was paid, which procedure continued in a
more or less degree during the following years, particularly in
1929 and 1934. The company, as you will see, earned $3,284,427.28
and paid out dividends of $4,200,000.00. In other
words, we declared practically $1,000,000 more during the
sixteen-year period than we earned.

"Under the circumstances I have no fault to find with this,
provided our principal stockholders, the Forestal Company, are
aware of it and are prepared to take care of our money situation
as the same arises....

"To come right down to the last analysis, we have been living
on Government funds, which under proper business procedure
should be reserved for income tax payments, but, as these
payments are not due until next year, it has been possible to use
this money. We owe the Government today $500,000. This
money, together with your most helpful postponement of payments,
has made it possible for us to have cash to pay the dividend
we did. I believe that with the extra terms on future
purchases of extract we will make our position stronger during
the next six months, and we are trying diligently not to borrow
from the banks, as in this particular case it would appear that
such borrowing was done to pay dividends. This I believe would
have a very bad effect on our good will and financial standing--and
we enjoy today the good will and respect of the tanning industry
as we never have before."

I have already pointed out that Forestal controls five of the
South American producers. One of the other seventeen is the
International Products Corporation of New York. Another
producer, Samuhi S. A., is controlled through ownership of a
majority of its stock by two American corporations, Proctor Ellison
and Howes Bros. of Massachusetts. International Products
Corporation and Samuhi together have a capacity of about
eight per cent of the entire industry. Both of these producers
have been ineffective in preventing La Forestal from carrying
out its policy of restricted output and high prices, and International
Products has in the past frequently cooperated closely
with La Forestal to further such a policy.

Since 1934 International Products Corporation has consulted
with Tannin about the prices to be charged to quebracho extract
consumers in the United States, so that the prices of both
companies have been fixed, uniform and high. From May,
1934 to July, 1939, Tannin owned a substantial amount of the
stock of International Products Corporation, and from May,
1934 until May, 1936, the president of Tannin, Carl B. Ely,
was a member of the Board of Directors of International Products
Corporation. On February 26, 1935, Ely wrote to Sullivan:

"I am giving the I.P.C. problems a lot of my time, and, as
previously told you, have found that there is a lot to be
done to straighten out that problem. I am working slowly so as
not to upset the apple cart any more than is necessary....

"I am getting their sales policies straightened out and believe
now there will be no more monkey business."

From 1934 to 1939 International Products Corporation was
a member of the Quebracho Pool, and by reason of its designation
as an official pool agent for the United States gave up its
business of selling extract in England and in Asia.

American purchasers of quebracho might well wonder whether
this American company was more concerned with giving them
a good deal or with favoring certain foreign concerns, from the
concluding paragraph of a letter from one of its officials to its
President dated November 16, 1939:

"You undoubtedly know that Mr. Seldes was successful in
substituting Casado extract to fill the order we had for Forestal
for 535 tons of Supremo for delivery in Buenos Aires for shipment
to Japan. We paid for the Casado extract with a dollar
draft and have since received from Forestal the sterling representing
the sale. The net result of the whole transaction represents
a loss of a little more than a $1.00 per ton, which, as explained
in a previous letter, is really not a loss at all, as we will
use this extract to fill orders for North America which will net
us a nice profit."

The production of Samuhi was so small, being about one per
cent of the entire industry, that it could hardly contain any
competitive threat to La Forestal. Nevertheless, our records
show that for many years Forestal harassed this company by
every means and sought to buy up its assets and its stock.

It is interesting to observe in what manner the quebracho extract
pool operated to carry out Forestal's policy of restricted
output and high prices. Before the formation of the Pool the
price per pound of quebracho extract was 2-1/2 cents. By the
terms of the pool agreement a directive committee, dominated
by Forestal, was empowered to fix the prices of all its members.
The directive committee between November, 1934 and January,
1941, decreed six price rises, raising the basic price of quebracho
extract for the whole world market from 2-1/2 cents up to 4-7/8
cents, an increase of nearly 100 per cent. Sullivan admitted in
July, 1942, that at the then existing price, which prevails at
present, Forestal was making a net profit of 33 per cent on
every ton of quebracho it sold.

The exorbitant profits of the quebracho manufacturers were
severely criticized by the famous leading Argentine newspaper,
<i>La Prensa</i>. The following excerpt was taken from a letter of
May 20, 1936, written by the manager of the Buenos Aires office
of the International Products Corporation to its president:

"Another matter, which has caused a lot of excitement
amongst the manufacturers has been the inopportune declaration,
made by the Chairman of the Forestal during the annual
meeting of the shareholders, viz. that the understanding of the
manufacturers was performed under the auspices of the Argentine
Government, in other words, that the Argentine Government
was really responsible for the agreement and that it
was protecting the same. This news was reproduced all over the
world and the <i>La Prensa</i>, the most important paper on the
Southern Hemisphere, has seized the opportunity to denounce
the huge profits made by the quebracho manufacturers, profits
which in their opinion mean a loss for the Argentine Republic
on account of the decrease in the export of both, Quebracho Extract
and Logs. I am enclosing herewith the article, as appeared
in the <i>La Prensa</i> of Monday the 18th. inst., and we
would add this paper has on more than one occasion criticized
the so-called 'gentlemen agreement.' Mr. Marti told
me that he is at a loss to understand how the Baron made these
declarations as Mr. Sullivan has always stressed the necessity
of not mentioning the Argentine Government in connection
with the manufacturers' agreement, a fact which can be noted in
the balance sheets of the other companies, who, referring to the
higher prices, explain that they are due to a better understanding
in the sales policy abroad. Anyway, I hope that his faux pas
will have no serious consequences."

To maintain high prices it was necessary to limit the production
and the sale of quebracho in the world market. The method
used to limit production under the pool agreement was to
allocate a quota to each producer in accordance with his respective
productive capacity. These quotas limited the amount of
quebracho extract which any manufacturer could sell during a
given period. Each member of the pool was compelled to make
substantial contributions at regular periods to a so-called "battle
fund" of the pool. These contributions were retained by
the pool unless the producers adhered to the pool's regulations
relating to prices and quotas, in which case a portion of each
producer's contribution was refunded. So restrictive were these
quota limitations that producers who desired to sell above their
quotas often paid enormous prices to acquire the quota rights of
other producers.

This rigid control of the market so severely limited the production
of many companies that in 1941 several deserted the
pool. These companies were LaChaquena S. A. and Cotan S. A.
These two companies, together with International Products
Corporation, Samuhi, and Weisburd & Cia. Ltda., a new concern,
have been the only producers outside of the pool since
1941. Although the total productive capacity of these five companies
did not exceed 12 per cent of the total industry, their
threat of full production and decreased prices jeopardized its
whole structure. To meet this threat, Forestal succeeded in
persuading the Ministry of Agriculture in February, 1942, to
impose export restrictions upon each producer which prevented
exportation of more than approximately one-third of their total
capacity. In addition, Forestal attempted to prevent companies
outside the pool from shipping their extract to the United
States.

One instance is the experience of Hammond and Carpenter
Corporation, an independent importer which has sought to
compete with The Tannin Corporation and International Products
Corporation in the importation of quebracho. In February
or March, 1942, J. A. Barkey, its Vice-President, attempted to
import some extracts produced by Weisburd, an Argentine extract
manufacturer, who entered the industry in 1941. He
called at the offices of the Sprague Steamship Company and
spoke to Mr. Bodemann of that company. Mr. Barkey later
described the conference as follows:

"Mr. Bodemann retorted that it was very unlikely that our
firm would be given any space for the reason that we were newcomers
in the import of quebracho extract and for the further
reason that the 'Pool' had supported his line during the lean
years before the war and by reason of such support his line
would be obliged to support the 'Pool' during the present emergency."

Similar sentiments were voiced by Mr. Horgan of the Stockard
Steamship Corporation. The aid of the Buenos Aires Agency
of Moore-McCormack was also previously enlisted. In October,
1941, the Moore-McCormack line stated that "at the
request of the Forestal Company they had promised their cooperation
for the purpose of keeping out any of the new brands....
The understanding was that whenever they were offered
outside extract and they had space they were to reject it and
advise the other manufacturers, who would try to offer replacement."

Forestal's tactics are well illustrated by the case of Mr. T.
Valentine, exporter and concessionnaire of a projected new company.
International Products Corporation was informed in September,
1941:

"[It] has proved impossible so far to reach a satisfactory
agreement with the new factory at Santiago del Estero. For this
reason, the Forestal Company, in an endeavor to impede the
exportation of the extract, has seen all the steamship companies
requesting them not to give space to any outsiders, but to advise
the Forestal who would immediately offer replacement cargo.
The steamship companies promised to act accordingly."

The Basal Agency had obtained shipping space for Valentine
in the past. "The Basal Agency," an official of International
Products wrote to Feeney a week later, "has informed us that
Valentine wants to book a further 200 tons on the next steamer
but that they would refuse to take it if we or the Forestal would
offer them replacement cargo."

The effect of the restrictive government decrees and other
measures taken by Forestal has been to force one independent,
Cotan, S.A., back into the Pool, while another, Samuhi, S.A., is
contemplating rejoining the Pool. It appears inevitable that
within a short period of time the remaining independents will
be forced into full cooperation with the Pool and that the industry's
policy of restrictive production and high prices will
continue unless some completely satisfactory substitute may be
found for quebracho extract. Apparently the tanners in this
country find that wattle extract is the only tanning product interchangeable
with quebracho extract, and it is therefore significant
to observe that the wattle extract industry, which is located
in South and East Africa, is also controlled by Forestal
of England, and that the principal importers of wattle in the
United States are the Tannin Corporation and International
Products Corporation.

The chief official of one of the companies which stood up
against the bulldozing tactics of the Pool wrote a letter to American
Tanners Ltd., on February 7, 1935. After discussing in a
critical manner the actions of the Pool and referring to a conversation
with an individual whom he said could be "interpreted
as a stool pigeon for Forestal," he wrote:

"We also pointed out the fact that if the arbitrary methods
of the gentlemen [the Pool] were pursued, that they were
throwing away their markets, they were encouraging the fields
of research and that they would wake up one day and find that
the volume of consumption of Quebracho Extract had been
greatly reduced due to the introduction of other materials
which supplanted Quebracho and I cited the instance of what
the tanners went through with substituted leather and how the
volume of the market had never been regained and that the
same thing would happen to Quebracho."

<i>Titanium</i>


The titanium industry is controlled by a typical cartel. That
it is a cartel there can be no question. The president of one of
the American companies which dominate it was thoughtful or
thoughtless enough to define it. He wrote to one of the European
officials as follows:

"May I call the proposed combination, for simplicity, a cartel?
The whole purpose of the cartel is to obtain a monopoly of
patents, so that no one can manufacture it [titanium] excepting
the members of the cartel, and so can raise the prices by reason
of such monopoly to a point that would give us much more
profit on our present tonnage, but also prevent a growth in
tonnage that would interfere with their greater profits in lithopone
[a competing but inferior product]."

It is typical because it has utilized the devices and followed
the practices which are found in greater or lesser degree in all
cartel arrangements. The members of this cartel include I. G.
Farbenindustrie, the German chemical trust and many other
foreign companies. The American scene is dominated by three
American corporations, the National Lead Company, E. I.
duPont de Nemours and Co., and Titan Co., Inc. (These three
companies and four of their leading officials were indicted by a
grand jury in the Southern District of New York on June 28,
1943.)

The story of the titanium cartel is significant for these reasons:

1. Titanium, the most valuable and useful of all white pigments
for paints, rubber products, glass, paper, enamel and
other materials has been priced exorbitantly and its use restricted
because of the monopolistic control exercised over it by a worldwide
cartel.

2. American members of the cartel are placed in a position
where they have felt obliged to help the Japanese evade the
British embargo.

3. American members have seen fit to aid I. G. Farben in
attempting to prevent seizure of German owned patents by the
American Alien Property Custodian by the execution of specious
patent assignments.

4. To attain such monopolistic control, the cartel has resorted
to flagrant misuse of patents and has gone so far as to actually
pay large sums to potential competitors to keep them out of the
titanium business.

5. I. G. Farben, the German chemical trust, as one of the
leading parties to the cartel, has dictated the terms upon which
American members might do business.

6. The fact that duPont, Imperial Chemical Industries and
I. G. Farben are also members of other cartels, such as that involving
dyestuffs, makes their control of a fine pigment such as
titanium the more objectionable.

It is difficult to think of any material which is more universally
used by private citizens and by governments alike than is
paint. In time of peace, the United States government buys and
uses enormous quantities of paint. In this time of war its purchases
account for by far the greater portion of all the paint
manufactured in the entire country.

It is a fact which is not widely known that the finest of all
white pigments, useful in colored paints as well as white, is
titanium dioxide. It is also not generally known that titanium is
the ninth most abundant element in the earth. Crude titanium
is found in combination with iron in an ore called ilmenite in
many places in this and other countries. It is found in purer
form in the sands of Travancore Beach in India and in lesser
concentration in many places.

While the element itself is abundant, no commercially practical
processes for reducing it to pigment form were known until
about the time of the first World War. In the relatively
short period which has passed since then, technology has been
developed which makes possible the manufacture of the finest
pigment from titanium. It has already displaced white lead,
lithopone and other pigments in a large share of the market.
In hiding power (covering qualities), opacity and chemical
inertness--all essential qualities for paints--titanium compounds,
chiefly titanium dioxide, excel all other kinds of pigments.

Shortly after the Civil War it was discovered that titanium
ore could be reduced to a powder which when mixed with oil
resulted in a paint. It was not until about the beginning of
World War I that a feasible method of separating titanium oxide
from the ore was worked out. This was accomplished by
two chemists, Dr. A. J. Rossi and L. E. Barton, whose research
was done for the Titanium Alloy Manufacturing Company organized
by Dr. Rossi and others in 1906. As a result of their
discovery, a new corporation called the Titanium Pigment Company
was formed in 1916. At that time, as well as subsequently,
the leading manufacturer of white pigment was the National
Lead Company. Recognizing the implications of titanium's excellence
in this field, National Lead purchased a substantial interest
in the Titanium Pigment Company in 1920. The two
companies continued to operate more or less separately until
1932 when National Lead acquired the entire stock of Titanium
Pigment. In 1936, the latter was dissolved as a corporation and
its business and properties were taken over and operated as a
division of National Lead.

During substantially the same period in which this development
was taking place in this country, a different process for the
manufacture of titanium compounds was being developed in
Norway by Gustav Jebsen. His process was patented and was
exploited by a Norwegian corporation called Titan Co. A/S.
At about the same time a Russian chemist named Joseph Blumenfeld
was perfecting, in France, another method of manufacture,
which was likewise patented. Thus prior to 1920 three
groups working independently of one another had developed
processes for utilizing titanium ore for production of pigments.
These groups are:

1. Titanium Pigment Company, subsequently absorbed in
National Lead Company.

2. Titan Co. A/S, originally organized in Norway by Jebsen
for the exploitation of his developments. Eighty-seven percent
of its stock was purchased by National Lead in 1927, the remaining
13% being retained by Jebsen. This company was
originally intended to exploit the foreign interests of National
Lead, but in 1929 National Lead and Jebson organized in Delaware
a holding company called Titan Co., Inc., the sole function
of which was to hold all foreign interests of the parties.
Titan Co. A/S remained in existence in Norway solely as the
sales agent for Titan Co., Inc.

3. The Blumenfeld Interests. Whereas National Lead and
Jebsen chose to exploit their patents by means of operating
companies, Blumenfeld followed a general policy of licensing
other interests.

Titanium Pigment and Titan Co. A/S entered into a contract
dated July 30, 1920, which is the foundation upon which the
parties and their successor companies have been able to build a
cartel with monopoly ramifications extending throughout the
world. This contract was to extend to 1936 and was to be
automatically renewed for 10-year periods unless terminated
by 5-year notice. By the terms of this agreement, National
Lead (as Titanium Pigment and its successor in interest will be
called) was assigned the markets of North America as its exclusive
territory. Titan Co. A/S was given the rest of the world
with the exception of South America which was to be common
territory. The two companies granted each other exclusive
licenses under their patents for their respective territories, excluding
even the licensor from the licensee's territory. Each
agreed not to ship into the other's territory and to prevent its
licensees from shipping their finished products into the other's
territory if it would interfere with the other party's sales. Any
sublicensee was required to be governed by the same restrictions
as the parties imposed upon themselves. The parties agreed to
exchange know-how and also to permit visits of representatives
to their respective plants. Each party undertook to secure from
its employees assignment of any and all inventions developed
by them. In acquiring rights to inventions from third parties,
each agreed to secure rights for all countries within the territory
of the other party.

Following the execution of the 1920 agreement, the parties
operated under it until 1927.

Jebsen, having Europe as part of his territory, set up a selling
company in France. This was originally intended to become a
manufacturing company also, but this idea was never carried
out. National Lead acquired a majority interest in this company
in 1927. At the same time it acquired 87% interest in
Titan Co. A/S, the Norwegian company, Jebsen retaining the
remaining 13%.

Also in 1927 National Lead and Jebsen formed a new company
in Germany in conjunction with I. G. Farben. This company,
Titangesellschaft, G.m.b.H., was organized as part of a
series of transactions including the execution of nine separate
contracts. Titangesellschaft was given as its exclusive territory
for manufacture and sale of titanium compounds the following
countries: Germany, Russia, Austria, Hungary, Czechoslovakia,
Switzerland, Rumania, Serbia, Jugoslavia, Bulgaria, Greece,
Turkey, Japan, China and Spain. In 1933 Titangesellschaft
eliminated potential competition on the part of the Sachtleben
Company in Germany by the simple expedient of paying it a
large sum of money for its agreement to stay out of the titanium
business.

In 1929, National Lead and Jebsen organized in Delaware a
company called Titan Co., Inc., for the purpose of holding their
foreign interests. Titan Co., Inc., succeeded to the position of
Titan Co. A/S (the Norwegian firm) under the basic agreement
of 1920. Thus we have National Lead as successor to Titanium
Pigment as one party to the basic agreement and Titan Co., Inc.,
owned 87% by National Lead, as the other party. However,
the 1920 agreement continues in existence inasmuch as its territorial
and license exchange restrictions form the basis and pattern
for all the subsequent agreements. Thus, Titan Co., Inc.,
became entitled to all territory outside North America except
as yielded up by the German agreements and others subsequent
to them.

Blumenfeld transferred all his patent rights to a French
company known as Societe de Products Chemiques des Terres
Rares. This concern then licensed or sold them to different companies
operating in various European countries, the British Empire
and United States.

In the United States, the patents were first owned by the
Commercial Pigments Corporation which sold them in 1931
to the Krebs Pigment and Color Corporation. At that time,
duPont owned 70% of the stock of Krebs. It subsequently acquired
100% and now operates it as the Krebs Division of
duPont. National Lead entered upon negotiations with duPont
looking toward an agreement which would allow the two companies
to maintain a monopoly of the titanium business in this
country and eliminate competition between them. I. G. Farben
insisted that in any such agreement duPont must obligate itself
not to compete or allow its sublicensees to compete in I. G.
Farben's territory, i.e., the world outside the Western Hemisphere.
When a proposed form of agreement was submitted to
I. G. Farben for approval, it objected because the license given
by duPont for foreign territory was a "non-exclusive license."
A National Lead official reassured I. G. Farben on this score in
the following language, quoted from a letter written in 1933:

"In regard to the phrase 'non-exclusive license' to which you
call our attention ... we have to refer to the United States
Anti-Trust Laws which absolutely forbid the granting of exclusive
licenses between two manufacturers in the United States
as such a practice would tend to create a monopoly. Therefore,
the use of this phrase 'non-exclusive license' is simply to comply
with the United States Laws and in practice the licenses under
each other's patents will undoubtedly prove to be, to all intents
and purposes, exclusive."

I. G. Farben's objections having been met and other difficulties
overcome, Titanium Pigments Co., Inc., and Krebs Pigment
and Color Corporation, subsidiaries of National Lead and
duPont, respectively, entered into an agreement dated January
1, 1933. It provided for a mutual grant of irrevocable and
"non-exclusive rights" and a license within the United States
to use all processes, methods and apparatus of manufacture including
present and future processes and patents. It also provided
that each party might sell the products resulting from the
exercise of the processes in the United States, Central and
South America. The territorial division of the basic agreement
of 1920 was thus preserved.

The agreement also provided for the exchange of the most
detailed information with respect to technical developments and
know-how "to the end that all the knowledge and experience
of each party in the licensed field shall be at the full disposal
of the other." This provision caused some little difficulty between
the parties. About 1937 I. G. Farben developed a new
titanium pigment (rutile) of exceptionally fine quality which
gave a great competitive advantage. It passed the information
concerning it to National Lead. The latter failed to inform
duPont of this development and when duPont later discovered
that such had been the case, it charged National Lead with violation
of its agreement. The net result was an amendment in
1941 of their agreement with the elimination of the exchange
of information provision. Actually, duPont itself developed a
similar rutile pigment and started production of it while National
Lead was still guarding the secret it had received from
I. G. Farben without producing the pigment.

The 1933 agreement further provided that each party was to
pay a royalty to the other on the basis of titanium dioxide produced
and packed by it. DuPont was to pay National Lead a
royalty of 2-1/2% based on the average published carload price
and National was to pay Krebs (duPont) 1% on a similar basis.
It was provided, however, that in no event was royalty to either
party to exceed $10,000 in any given year and all royalties were
to cease as of December 31, 1936. The parties undertook to
use their best efforts to acquire the rights for each other from
third parties and duPont further agreed to offer licenses to the
foreign associates of National Lead for the various countries of
the world. This virtually was a commitment by duPont to give
National Lead's foreign subsidiaries a preference in granting
licenses.

Following the execution of the duPont-National Lead
Agreement in 1933, duPont entered into a series of four contracts
with Titan Company, Inc. By these agreements, duPont
agreed to turn over all its foreign patents to the various foreign
associates of Titan Company, Inc. The result was a virtual
consolidation of all the important titanium interests throughout
the world. All commercially useful patents were under the control
of the parties involved. Future control was assured by the
various provisions of the agreements requiring the continuing
exchange of licenses and patents to the practical exclusion of all
would-be competitors.

At the time of the formation of Titangesellschaft, it was the
intention of the National Lead-I. G. groups to extend their
facilities into any country if and when it seemed necessary.
From time to time beginning in 1933 the National-Titan-I. G.
group because of threatened competition in one country after
another was forced to take action to control the various competitive
forces. This happened in Great Britain, Canada and
Japan.

As early as 1930 the British Chemical Trust, Imperial Chemical
Industries, Ltd., evidenced a desire to engage in the titanium
business and in fact carried on considerable research work
in that connection. This came to the attention of the National
Lead-Titan group and prompted them to take action to control
the development in the British Empire. At that time, the
Blumenfeld British patents were owned by National Titanium
Pigments Co., Ltd. It was feared by the National Lead-Titan
group that National Titanium Pigments, I. C. I. and Imperial
Smelting Corporation would undertake a joint enterprise and
thus offer formidable competition in that territory. After considerable
negotiation, a jointly owned corporation, British Titan
Products Ltd., was formed. The stock was owned 49% by
Titan Co., Inc., and 51% by I. C. I., Imperial Smelting and
Goodlass Wall Lead Industries, Ltd., in equal shares. In conjunction
with the formation of the new corporation, the participating
companies executed a series of agreements, the purpose
and result of which was to divide territory and avoid competition
among the various companies. The principal contract
between Titan Co., Inc., and British Titan Products was to extend
to 1963 and to continue in force thereafter until cancelled
by either party upon twelve months' notice. It is still in effect.
The Blumenfeld patents had been acquired by the British Laporte
Co. and negotiations between Laporte and British Titan
Products were carried on in 1940 and 1941. In August 1941 an
agreement in principle was arrived at. This provided that Laporte
was to receive 20% of the British market for the duration
of the war. British Titan Products tried to make it for a longer
period and stated its willingness to concede a larger proportion
of the market, but Laporte refused. Jebsen, now as an officer
of a National Lead subsidiary, gave his approval to this agreement
and stated that he was quite satisfied that it was only for
the duration because he felt that British Titan Products would
be much better off after the war as a result of the developments
which they would get from National Lead. He felt that they
could use these developments to advantage in dealing with
Laporte in postwar negotiations.

The most important chemical company in Canada is Canadian
Industries, Ltd. (C. I. L.), most of the stock of which is
owned by duPont and I. C. I. Under the basic agreement of
1920 Canada was within the territory assigned to National Lead
and it supplied most of the Canadian market until the early
thirties when British Titan Products was allowed to ship into
Canada on a preferential basis. The British Laporte Company
was also shipping into the Canadian market. Although it held
the Canadian Blumenfeld patents, it did not undertake to manufacture
in that country. DuPont also was exporting to Canadian
buyers and for a number of years the various companies participated
in price stabilizing agreements.

In 1937 National Lead and C. I. L. organized Canadian Titanium
Pigments, Ltd. (51% C. I. L.--49% National Lead)
for the manufacture and sale of titanium in the Canadian market.
At the same time, they purchased the Blumenfeld Canadian
patents from Laporte. A series of contracts executed by National
Lead, C. I. L. and Canadian Titanium Pigments contain
the usual provisions for division of territory, licensing of
patents, control of shipment of manufactured products, exchange
of know-how, etc. The principal contract extends until
1967. National Lead continues to sell Canadian Titanium Pigments
all its requirements for the Canadian market. However,
it is obligated to cease all exports to Canada as soon as Canadian
Titanium Pigments builds a factory which is scheduled for erection
immediately after the war.

The only remaining country of any commercial consequence
was Japan. By virtue of the European cartel agreements, the
Japanese market had been assigned to the Titangesellschaft and
to the Blumenfeld French company in the ratio of 70-30. The
Titan Co., Inc., owning 50% of Titangesellschaft, profited by
this arrangement. From the time of the execution of these
agreements until 1937, the Japanese market was supplied with
products manufactured in Germany. From time to time, however,
there were indications of independent competition which
finally became so threatening to their control that the National
Lead-I. G. Farben interests thought it necessary to undertake
development of a domestic manufacturing plant in Japan.

After considerable negotiation and the overcoming of many
difficulties, the various interested companies executed a series
of seven contracts providing for the formation of a new company
known as Titan Kogyo Kabushiki Kaisha. The participating
companies were National Lead and I. G. Farben operating
through their jointly owned subsidiary, Titangesellschaft, Blumenfeld's
French company, and a Japanese chemical company,
the Kokusan Kogyo Kabushiki Kaisha. Neither National
Lead nor Blumenfeld had any direct contact with the operations
of the Japanese company inasmuch as all matters were handled
through I. G. Farben by its Japanese representative, Doitsu
Senryo Gomei Kaisha. By virtue of the executed contracts,
Kokusan was given 50% of the stock of Titan Kogyo. Titan
Co., Inc. (representing National Lead's interests) received
17-1/2%; I. G. Farben, 17-1/2% and Blumenfeld's French company,
15%. Because of restrictions of the German government,
I. G. Farben was unable to supply capital necessary to subscribe
for its share of the stock. Consequently, Titan Co., Inc., subscribed
for I. G. Farben's share and gave the latter an option
to purchase these shares at any subsequent time.

Because of German participation in the Japanese Titanium
Company, the British Government refused to permit titanium
from Travancore, India, to be exported to Japan in the fall and
winter of 1940-41. Titanium was badly needed in Japan and
the Japanese government had not permitted any titanium pigments
to be exported for a long time. Knowing this and in
spite of the fact that the situation in this country was very serious
because of disruption of shipping and inadequacy of domestic
supplies, nevertheless Titanium Pigment (National Lead)
shipped 700 tons to Titan Kogyo Kaisha, Ltd. on March 9,
1941, thus aiding the Japanese to evade the embargo which
the British had with good cause placed on sale to Japan. In a
letter dated April 3, 1941, the manager of Titanium Pigments
wrote to the Japanese company:

"Even at the time we made shipment to you of 700 tons on
March 9th, the situation was so serious that we should have
much preferred not to have released even this quantity, but in
view of the fact that we had promised it to you early last fall,
we felt that we should not withdraw our offer. Incidentally,
at the time we made this shipment to you in March, the replacement
value of that ore was more than double the price at which
we invoiced it to you."

The extent to which one member of a cartel will go in protecting
the interests of a foreign partner and incidentally in
attempting to safeguard its own monopoly position is indicated
by the following letter and resolution. The letter dated December
11, 1939, is from the manager of National Lead's Patent
Department to the General Manager of the Titanium Division.

"Confirming our recent conversations, regarding exchange
of title to patents, I beg to review the situation for you.

"On September 7th I wrote Dr. Jebsen, pointing out that in
view of the war certain questions arose affecting the United
States patents which stand in the name of Titangesellschaft and
the I. G. Farbenindustrie under which we enjoy an exclusive
license. We suggested to Dr. Jebsen that it might be desirable
to assign to National Lead Company, in trust, the patents of
the I. G. Farbenindustrie and Titangesellschaft against the possibility
of the United States entering the war and taking over
these patents. <i>The suggestion was primarily designed to protect
the patent property of the I. G. Farbenindustrie and Titangesellschaft
and at the same time would have protected our exclusive
license by insuring that no one else could have petitioned
the government to secure licenses under them.</i> On December
7th I received the following cable from Dr. Jebsen:

"The suggestion here is that Titangesellschaft will assign
their United States patents and applications to National Lead
Co. and National Lead Co. and Titan Co., Inc., will assign
their applications and patents in Germany, and other countries
within Titangesellschaft's territory to Titangesellschaft....
Several years ago National Lead Company formally renounced
maintenance of any European patents owned by it, putting
upon Titan Co., Inc., the obligation to pay all maintenance
charges and hence, under the Agreement of 1920, Titan Co.,
Inc., could have requested formal assignment of these patents.
They have not done so in order to save the expense of preparing
the assignments and recording them in the various countries.
The question is, therefore, whether Titan Co., Inc.,
should assign its patents and applications to Titangesellschaft.

"In discussing this matter with you on December 8th, <i>it appeared
to us that to assign these patents in Germany to Titangesellschaft
might involve some risks for the future. For instance,
if the Germans owned all the patents now held in Germany by
Titan Co., Inc., and if, as a result of the war they were forced
by their government</i>, or through other circumstances, <i>to abrogate
the main agreement, they would be free to export their
products and, in general, take themselves outside of the titanium
family cooperation</i>. I cabled this thought to Dr. Jebsen, soliciting
his views. A reply has just been received which reads as
follows:

/#
"'PROPOSAL MY CABLE DECEMBER 7 IS NOT TGS BUT MINE STOP
CONSIDER THIS BEST PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES TO SECURE LEGAL POSITION
ALL AROUND STOP EXACTLY LEGAL POSTWAR POSITION PATENTS
OTHERWISE VERY UNCERTAIN STOP <i>PREVENTION IMPORT PARTLY SECURED
IN FUTURE BY PATENTS IN RESPECTIVE COUNTRIES BUT WILL BE
CHIEFLY SECURED BY ALL COMPANIES SELFISH INTEREST IN COOPERATION
BECAUSE OF ADVANTAGES ALREADY REALIZED BY EXPERIENCE</i>.'
#/

"You will see that Dr. Jebsen believes that in view of the war
the best possible legal position for each of the members of the
family is to hold title to all patents in its territory. He believes
that prevention of import and export competition will chiefly be
secured in the future through the individual company's recognition
of the advantages to be derived from maintaining the cooperation,
having through experience appreciated the value of
this cooperation.

"It should be noted in this connection that even if Titan Co.,
Inc., retained title to the patents in Germany, and should the
government force abrogation of the main agreements, particularly
with a view to fostering German exports, they will find
means to negate Titan Co., Inc.'s patent rights also. <i>Should the
situation develop where Titangesellschaft is forced, perhaps
against its will, to engage in export competition with other members
of the titanium family, then, as pointed out by Dr. Jebsen,
that competition can be controlled by patents owned by the other
members of the family in their particular territories.</i> Therefore,
I believe we should approve Dr. Jebsen's proposal."

That this plan was put into effect is shown by a resolution
adopted by the Board of Directors of Titan Co., Inc., on December
19, 1939:

"Resolved, in furtherance of that certain License Agreement
between Titan Co. A/S (predecessor in interest of this corporation)
and Titangesellschaft m. b. H., of Leverkusen, Germany,
dated October 3/20, 1937, and pursuant to the recommendation
of Dr. G. Jebsen, Vice-President of this corporation,
the officers of this corporation be and they hereby are authorized
and empowered to execute and deliver in its name and
behalf appropriate assignments to said Titangesellschaft of all
patents and patent applications of this corporation, within the
Licensed Field as defined in said Agreement, in countries now
embraced within the territory of said Titangesellschaft as defined
in said Agreement and subsequent amendments thereto, in
consideration of the execution and delivery by said Titangesellschaft
to this corporation of appropriate assignments of all patents
and patent applications of said Titangesellschaft, within
said Licensed Field, in countries embraced within the territory
of this corporation as defined in said Agreement and subsequent
amendments thereto; and upon the express understanding and
condition that such reciprocal assignments shall in no way alter
or limit the general intent and operating effect of said Agreement
of the several other rights and obligations of the respective
parties thereto."

Among the patents so assigned to avoid seizure by the Alien
Property Custodian is one covering the new rutile pigment previously
mentioned.

In the cable which has just been cited, and the action taken
pursuant to it, there is an example of postwar planning which
has been all too prevalent in these cartel groups. This is not the
only instance in which a German company's United States patents
have been taken over by an American cartel partner to avoid
seizure by the Alien Property Custodian. The understanding
that such assignments shall only operate during the war and
that after the war the game shall take up where it left off is of
great importance. Government postwar planning should not fail
to take into account and deal forcefully with the secret postwar
plans of private cartels.

In a system of free enterprise, the superior product which
can be produced and sold at the lowest price is able to take the
place of competing products inferior in quality or higher in
price. Under a cartel system inferior or more expensive products
are allowed to hold a share of the market which they would
lose on a competitive basis.

This is well illustrated in the case of titanium pigment and
an inferior product called lithopone. The latter is a pigment
in the manufacture and marketing of which duPont has taken
a leading part for many years. Since 1933 National Lead and
duPont have maintained identical prices for titanium compounds.
There have been changes in market prices on the average
of twice a year on all grades of pigments and in every instance
the effective date of price change of each party has been
the same. With respect to lithopone which is competitive with
the calcium sulphate composite pigment, there has been maintained
a constant differential. Unless the lithopone were priced
below the titanium compound, it could not sell. Therefore, irrespective
of costs of production the titanium compound has
been priced 2 cents a pound above the price of lithopone. An
honest technologist who knows that a better product can be
made at a profit to undersell an inferior competing product
cannot be expected to be happy in a situation which holds back
the better and aids the poorer.

One of the worst features of cartel control lies in the overlapping
of fields which is found in the case of large companies such
as duPont and I. G. Farben. These companies are largely concerned
not only with the production of pigments but also many
other chemical products.

It is difficult to believe that the public interest has been adequately
served by having the most valuable of white pigments
subjected to complete control in this country and throughout the
world by a cartel. What steps a free technology unfettered by
cartel restrictions might have taken one cannot say with certainty.
One may be quite sure that when the cartel shackles are
broken, titanium will take its rightful place as not only the
most important and useful of all pigments but also for a wide
variety of other industrial uses.

<i>Optical Instruments</i>


How was it possible for Nazi Germany to emerge as a fully
armed aggressor nation when she had been so thoroughly disarmed
as a result of the Versailles Treaty? What can be done to
prevent German technology from being utilized in preparation
for another war? I propose in this chapter to discuss a particular
cartel situation which sheds much light on the first question
and will, I believe, be of value in finding an answer to the
second.

There were, of course, many factors which contributed to the
failure of the Versailles Treaty to accomplish the permanent
peace which was contemplated at the time of its execution. It
is my purpose to show herein that there was a definite program
to sabotage the effectiveness of the Treaty and that that program
was conceived in Germany almost as soon as the peace was
made and many years before Hitler came into power. Furthermore,
I shall prove, on the basis of documentary evidence, that
evasion of the disarmament provisions of the Versailles Treaty
was facilitated by a cartel agreement between a German firm
and an American corporation. The agreement was between Carl
Zeiss of Jena, Germany, and the Bausch and Lomb Optical
Company of Rochester, New York.

In March, 1940, Bausch and Lomb and Carl Zeiss were indicted
for violation of the antitrust laws. Pleas of <i>nolo contendere</i>
were made, fines paid and thus trial of the indictment was
avoided. A civil complaint and consent decree were filed in
July 1940. The investigations in connection with this case revealed
the following:

(1) Action was taken in 1921 to nullify the provisions of the
Versailles Treaty which prohibited Germany from large scale
manufacturing of military equipment.

(2) The parties caused Zeiss patents in this country to be
taken out in the name of Bausch and Lomb, thus giving an
appearance of American ownership and consequent protection
against seizure by an Alien Property Custodian.

(3) Secret United States military information was given by
Bausch and Lomb to Germans not only before but after Hitler
came into power.

(4) Unknown to the Navy a secret commission to Bausch
and Lomb was included in prices paid by the Navy for equipment
furnished by Zeiss.

(5) Public declarations were made as to a policy of not selling
military equipment to England and France for fear it
might be used against this country, when the reason such policy
existed was because of the provisions of a secret agreement with
a German concern.

(6) Threats of patent infringement were used to frighten
competing firms bidding upon military equipment for the
United States Army.

(7) The cost to United States users of binoculars was greatly
increased by reason of the efforts of Bausch and Lomb to protect
itself from competition in that field.

No one factor is of greater importance in the waging of modern
mechanized warfare than the precision instruments which
indicate the exact location of a target and permit the accurate
aiming of the gun or other device which will throw the projectile.
The instruments which come in this category include periscopes,
range finders, height finders, boresights, bombsights,
telescopes, torpedo directors, gunsights, searchlight lenses and
reflectors, as well as others. The glass which is used in making
such instruments is of extremely high quality, it being absolutely
essential that it be free from striae or streaks, bubbles, cloudiness
and other defects which would impair its transparency or
refractivity. At the outbreak of the first World War practically
all such glass was made in Germany at the Schott glass works
at Jena. Moreover, practically all first quality military optical
instruments were also made in Germany, at Jena, in the factory
of the Carl Zeiss Stiftung. The latter is a foundation created
by bequests from Carl Zeiss and Dr. Ernest Abbe for the purpose
of perpetuating the instrument business which their research
had founded. By the time of the first World War it had
grown into a tremendous establishment employing something
like 10,000 people and supplying most of the Kaiser's war machine
with optical-gunfire control instruments. Its continuance
as a large scale producer of war instruments was entirely inconsistent
with the aims and provisions of the Versailles Treaty.

Prior to the first World War Bausch and Lomb had been
manufacturing military optical goods from glass imported from
Germany. This had resulted from an agreement made in 1907.
Carl Zeiss had threatened to establish a factory in the United
States and sent a representative, Professor Tschopski, to this
country in that connection. Apparently frightened by this
threat, Bausch and Lomb entered into a series of transactions
intended to eliminate any such competition. This was the so-called
Optical Triple Alliance. The Fauth Instrument Company
of which George Saegmuller was president was absorbed
by Bausch and Lomb, and Saegmuller became vice-president of
the latter firm. Carl Zeiss acquired one-fifth of Bausch and
Lomb's capital stock and representation on its board of directors.
Zeiss abandoned its plan to establish a factory in the United
States, and Bausch and Lomb agreed to buy its glass for military
optical instruments exclusively from Zeiss. In 1915 Zeiss
refused to continue to supply Bausch and Lomb with glass,
under their arrangements of 1907, because the Rochester firm
had been supplying military instruments to countries which
were at war with Germany. The Zeiss interest in Bausch and
Lomb was purchased by members of the Bausch and Lomb
families. Upon our entrance into the war in 1917 it was found
that one of the most badly needed war materials was military
optical goods. Neither the glass itself nor the instruments had
been produced in this country in adequate quantities prior to
the war. The Geophysical Laboratory, the Bureau of Standards,
Bausch and Lomb, the Spencer Lens Co., and the Pittsburgh
Plate Glass Co., worked strenuously on a program to produce
adequate quantities of proper quality optical glass. Between
April 1917 and November 1918 over 600,000 pounds of
usable optical glass were produced, 65 per cent of it by Bausch
and Lomb. Under the stress of war, the manufacture of military
optical-gunfire control instruments was increased to the extent
necessary to supply the fighting arms of the service.

Confronted with the restrictions imposed by the Versailles
Treaty the heads of Carl Zeiss were more than glad to work
out, in 1921, a secret agreement with Bausch and Lomb. To
summarize this agreement, Zeiss placed its know-how at the disposal
of Bausch and Lomb. The latter agreed to pay Zeiss a
royalty starting at 7% and gradually diminishing for 25 years
on all its military optical business except field glasses. As indicated
quite plainly by the third paragraph of the agreement, the
two companies divided up the world insofar as the sale of military
optical goods was concerned:

"B. & L. obligate themselves not to sell, directly or indirectly,
Military instruments to countries outside of the United States of
America, and vice versa Carl Zeiss obligate themselves not to
sell such instruments, directly or indirectly to the United States
unless the parties have come to an agreement regarding the conditions
of sale and the respective territories of distribution."

In the fourth paragraph, Zeiss was given the power to pass
upon who should become the heads of the Bausch and Lomb
"Military Department."

"In furtherance of the aims of this agreement B. & L. in
Rochester will create a new Department solely responsible to
the Board of Directors, which is charged with the independent
development of all scientific and technical tasks within the Military
scope and the maintenance of connections with Jena. The
parties will come to an agreement as regards the heads to be
placed in charge of this department."

In non-military fields the parties, while competing, were to
give due regard to each other's interests. In the military field
they agreed to full exchange of know-how and to rights under
inventions acquired by them. The eighth paragraph anticipated
the possibility of a conflict between the obligations to each other
under the agreement and those owing to the nation: "The mutual
obligation regarding the exchange of Military designs shall
be void whenever the highest home Government of one party
expressly demands that they be kept in confidence in the interest
of the nation."

As will be shown, Zeiss subsequently demonstrated a very
keen awareness of the privilege thus accorded it to obey Hitler's
edicts and to keep its know-how in Germany. Bausch and Lomb
on the other hand on more than one occasion weighed the demand
for secrecy by our Army and Navy against the obligation
to keep Zeiss informed and decided in favor of the latter. Both
parties were fully aware of the fact that such an agreement had
to be kept secret. It was intended to give Zeiss a new lease on
life and actually made it possible for that concern to continue
its existence in spite of the disarming of Germany and its war
partners. The contract bluntly stated: "The contracting parties
agree to keep the foregoing agreement in strict confidence as regards
a third party and to guard silence concerning this agreement
also with their own employees as far as this may be practical
under the circumstances."

In contending that the contract was not secret, Bausch and
Lomb states: "The original contract was shown to the U. S.
Naval Observer in Berlin within a month of its execution, and
through him the Bureau of Naval Intelligence and the Bureau
of Ordnance were informed." As a matter of fact it seems
clear that what was shown to our Naval representative in Berlin
was not the "original contract" but only a portion of it with a
certain other part withheld. The explanation for withholding
part was that it related to matters which did not concern the
Navy. The Navy representative was told that the Bausch and
Lomb connection with Zeiss must be kept strictly confidential
to protect Zeiss. The latter was not permitted under the terms
of the Versailles Peace Treaty to continue the manufacture of
military optical goods. In this connection a letter from George
N. Saegmuller to Bausch and Lomb, sent from Jena on May 6,
1921, is of interest (Saegmuller was the vice-president of the
firm who had gone to Germany to execute the agreement with
Zeiss):

"I hope you rec'd our cable via Frankfurt in regard to the
signing of the agreement Apr 29th and also my letter of even
date in which I entered into the subject more fully. In that letter
I stated that Capt. Bechler, Naval representative of the Am.
Commission, telephoned for me to come to Berlin. This I intended
to do but upon reflection I thought it best for him to
come here as the various instruments in which they are interested
are here. He assented to this and was to come yesterday
but was taken sick so in place sent his aid, Lieut. Culbert, U.
S. N., who was also accompanied by the Military represt. of the
Am. Commission. What the Navy wants at once are: [enumerating
range-finders, periscopes, sights and other similar
instruments].

"For these instruments they are in a hurry and most probably
we will have to import the optics from here as it would
be impossible for us to produce them in time even with Zeiss
opticians. I thought it best to go with Fred to Berlin to see
Comdr. Bechler & impress upon him the importance of finding
out how many of the various instruments are wanted, so as to
receive the optics in time.

"<i>The Navy Department wants to obtain a copy of the agreement
as a kind of a guarantee that if they order from us they
will really receive Zeiss instruments or rather Zeiss quality. I
told Lieut. Culbert that in my opinion there would be no difficulty
in giving them a copy of the agreement which relates to
military instruments. An entire copy we could not give as it
relates to matters which does not concern the Navy; I wrote
out what I thought and gave it to Dr. Fischer who will consult
with the others; I don't think there will be any trouble on that
score. I told both officers that our connection with Zeiss must
be kept strictly confidential, chiefly on acc't of Zeiss; this they
understand.</i>"

The reason it was necessary to keep the agreement secret is
quite obvious but it need not be left to inference. On Dec. 27,
1930, Bausch and Lomb wrote to Interflash Signal Corporation
of New York in reply to an inquiry concerning a range finder
for the Grecian Navy Department. The letter contains this language:

"Our activities in the military line of instruments in general
are concentrated in supplying the requirements of our own
Government. While we have occasionally supplied foreign
Governments with a few of these instruments, this has only been
by chance as far as our facilities have permitted. We appreciate
very much the offer of Admiral Dedes to become our special
representative, but under the circumstances above stated we are
unfortunately not in a position to accept this offer. We would
suggest that he communicate with our friends, the Nederlandsche
Instrumenten Compagnie, Den Haag, Holland, who
manufacture the military line of optical instruments formerly
made by Messrs. Carl Zeiss of Jena, Germany, <i>the latter not
being permitted under the terms of the Peace Treaty to continue
the manufacture of these products</i>...."

On October 20, 1926, Bausch and Lomb wrote a letter to
one of its representatives in the New York City office. J. A.
Scheick of that office had quoted a price on two range finders to
a New York firm which intended to ship them to Laredo,
Texas for the ultimate use of the War Department of Mexico.
The letter states:

"We have, on previous occasions, explained to Mr. Scheick
that we must know the customer for whom this Military equipment
is ultimately intended and we have also withdrawn our
previous quotations stating that by reason of the limited supply
of instruments on hand, it would be best to refer all such inquiries
first to us, to find out whether or not we can take care
of such an order. <i>The real reason, as you are aware, is our
agreement with Zeiss, which, of course, we cannot explain to
Mr. Scheick, as we are not only required to keep the nature of
the agreement confidential, but the very existence of such an
agreement.</i> As you are probably aware, this prevents us from
making sales in the Military line, directly or indirectly, outside
of the United States, unless by previous agreement with Zeiss
on the price question; the price agreed to by Zeiss will be
higher than their direct quotation. Obviously, we cannot accept
the inclosed order intended for the War Department of
Mexico."

The 1921 agreement was to run for 20 years with Bausch
and Lomb obligated to continue to pay royalties for 25 years
on all its military business whether based on Zeiss patents or not.

To carry out its agreement with Bausch and Lomb, Zeiss used
the device of a corporation organized in Holland called N. V.
Nederlandsche Instrumenten Compagnie--or Nedinsco, for
short. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of Zeiss with its principal
office at The Hague and its plant at Venlo, a town on the
German border. Thus, in the years which passed before Hitler
came into power in the face of the disarmament provisions of
the Versailles Treaty, Carl Zeiss was enabled to continue in the
production of military optical equipment by merely moving its
plant across the border. It was assured of and received royalties
from all sales of such equipment in the United States by Bausch
and Lomb, and assured of and received for Nedinsco freedom
from competition in all the rest of the world so far as Bausch
and Lomb was concerned. The survival of Carl Zeiss and its
ability to provide at Jena one of the most important cogs in
the Hitler war machine is clearly understandable and is in
large part the result of the secret agreement of 1921.

The following paragraphs from a letter from Bausch and
Lomb to Zeiss dated February 10, 1939, substantiates this statement:

"We are uncertain whether your reference to the more distant
past is intended to cover the period between 1907 and 1915,
during which time we freely admit that you were of assistance
to us in the establishment of our military department, or to
the period following the resumption of our cooperative endeavor
after the World War.

"On the assumption that you are referring to the earlier
period, we believe that you were completely compensated by
the dividends which you received on the stock held in our
company and by the appreciation in the value of this stock which
you realized at the time of its sale.

"If, on the other hand, you are referring to the later period,
<i>we believe that inasmuch as the arrangement made accomplished
the primary objective of keeping your scientific staff
intact at a time when you could not manufacture war materials,
you were adequately compensated, particularly in view of the
fact that, as you then knew, our Government was at that time
very little interested in the development of, and made but very
small appropriations for, fire control apparatus. In other words,
we believe that the development work which you did during
this period was primarily for your own benefit and not of great
value to us here.</i>"

Here we see quite clearly how an American company aided
a German company avoid both the spirit and the letter of the
Versailles Treaty. Although Germany was prohibited from
manufacturing and exporting military equipment, Bausch and
Lomb "accomplished the primary objective of keeping your
scientific staff intact at a time when you [Zeiss] could not manufacture
war materials." In response to the letter just quoted,
Zeiss replied on July 22, 1939:

"<i>In reference to 2.</i> In the reference to our letter of January
3, 1939, page 2, to a more remote time, that is, the time further
back than 5 years, we have had reference to the first decade of
the operation of the agreement as it now exists. Your assumption
that during that time the development work done for you
was above all to our advantage and had served the purpose of
maintaining our design force is absolutely misjudged. <i>We had
at no time the intention to allow our experience and knowledge
of the military business to rest but have, as you know, established
the Nedinsco branch for the express purpose so as to keep
our place in the world market.</i> If the Nedinsco was a successful
competitor where high grade equipment of our sphere of activities
was in demand, this success is due to the work and
efforts of our scientific staff and technicians who building on
experiences before and during the war have explored all kinds
of military spheres for our designs. The fruits of this successful,
constructive labor has of course been reaped in general by
Nedinsco. Surely we could not have continued the development
work of even a small part of these activities from the small
royalties received from you. From this follows definitely that
you were the one who profited, without merit of your own, from
the advantages of our complex and expensive development
work, and that you unfortunately, notwithstanding repeated
urging on our part, did not sufficiently make use of the given
possibilities, a fact with which we found fault repeatedly verbally
and in writing."

The sentence which I have italicized is a positive statement
by Zeiss of its utter disregard of the conditions imposed by the
Peace Treaty.

On June 27, 1925 a supplemental agreement was made
which slightly changed the royalty provisions of the 1921 agreement.
The division of world territory remained as before, except
that the parties undertook to protect each other in bidding
on government contracts by overbidding.

Subsequently on October 28, 1925, a further supplemental
agreement was signed by Zeiss at Jena and on December 11 by
Bausch and Lomb at Rochester. After repeating the provisions
of the supplemental agreement of June 27, 1925, it added:

"In case the inquiries referred to in paragraph 2 and 3 should
not come to Bausch & Lomb from a Government, but exceptionally
from a commercial house of a country outside of the United
States, the firm of Bausch & Lomb is to communicate immediately
with the firm of Nedinsco, and, depending on the situation
at Nedinsco, either to make the protective offer named to
her by the latter firm, or to decline the inquiry under pretense.
The information in question will be given to the firm of Bausch
& Lomb by the firm of Nedinsco."

The second supplemental agreement also contained the following
provision:

"If the firm of Bausch & Lomb is furnishing to American
shipyards, optical instruments as equipment for a ship of a
country outside of the United States, all instruments in which
the ideas of construction of the firm of Carl Zeiss have been
used, shall, besides the trade name of Bausch & Lomb, be engraved
with the designation, "System Nedinsco-Zeiss." Instruments
according to the construction of Bausch & Lomb shall
bear only their name. On instruments furnished by Nedinsco
the name of Nedinsco will appear next to the name of Bausch
& Lomb."

Thus, as early as 1925 there is evidence of the determination
to place the Zeiss name back in the consciousness of the world.
One more step was thereby taken to nullify the effect of the
Versailles Treaty and to reestablish Germany in her place in
the sun.

In 1926 Bausch and Lomb caused the 1921 agreement and
its supplements to be modified because its counsel declared them
to be wholly invalid as violating the antitrust laws. In place
of the division of territory provision in the third paragraph, as
quoted previously, the following language was inserted: "The
license hereby granted is exclusive, the firm of Carl Zeiss agrees
that it will grant no license to another American manufacturer."

This was a change in the language of the agreement to give
an appearance of legality. Actually, after 1926, as well as before,
the parties maintained a definite and illegal division of
territory. The following sentences from a memorandum of
Edward Bausch, dated January 27, 1927, show that no change
in the actual relationship took place in the previous year: "It is
my understanding, in accordance with the opinion of Carl Lomb,
that we are not to bid on any military instruments for use anywhere
outside of the U. S. The agreement is that if such inquiries
come to us we are to refer them to Zeiss."

Paragraph 9 of the 1921 agreement, quoted above, providing
for strict secrecy as to the agreement was dropped out as being
(in 1926) unwise and unnecessary. In its place was inserted
an innocuous provision that neither party has any claims against
the other arising from previous agreements. This agreement of
1926, along with the early agreements which it purported to
supersede was declared in violation of the antitrust laws by
the decree entered by the court on July 9, 1940.

The 1921 agreement and also those which were subsequently
executed contemplated an exchange of information and experience
between the parties. This included the right of each party
to send confidential representatives to the workshops of the
other. Bausch and Lomb was more than anxious to have Zeiss
employees visit its plant and its only complaint in connection
with the visit of one such employee was that he had not been
of great help to Bausch and Lomb while in this country. When
Hitler came into power the American company found the door
to the Zeiss designing rooms closed to it.

In a memorandum of April 19, 1938 Carl L. Bausch, Vice
President of Bausch and Lomb, quoted paragraph VII of the
contract providing for exchange of experience and access to the
workshop and then stated: "In 1934, although they allowed
me to go through their plant at Venlo, I could see none of the
work that was being done at Jena, although all the design, part
work and optical work was being done there at that time." In
the same memorandum Mr. Bausch stated:

"My contention is that over the past five years we have paid
out $139,000 without receiving any benefit from it except for
the fact that our contract might have kept Zeiss out of this
market. I doubt very much whether our government would
have purchased any Zeiss range finders, even if Zeiss was allowed
to solicit business."

In a letter from Carl Zeiss to Bausch and Lomb dated January
3, 1939 referring to the period of the past five years, i.e.,
since Hitler came into power, Zeiss said: "It certainly cannot
be denied that we have been restricted in many respects in the
execution of the agreement out of national interests particularly
as far as visiting our plant is concerned."

In the matter of knowing what Zeiss was building for Hitler,
of course, there was no passing of information to Bausch and
Lomb. On the other hand, Zeiss was kept informed at least
until well into the Hitler regime as to what was being ordered
by our military departments. This was done not by sending the
information directly to Zeiss but through Bausch and Lomb's
German representative. August Lomb of Bausch and Lomb
G.m.b.H. Frankfurt-on-the-Main acted as the conduit for the
information. On July 9, 1929 Bausch and Lomb wrote to August
Lomb as follows:

"We are appending our report which will bring the Military
transactions up to date.

"We have nothing further to say at this time than what has
already been stated in our report as regards the confidential
nature of this information. Heretofore, the Government has
merely been insistent that none of the details as regards the design
of these instruments be made public, but lately it seems as
if the quantities, prices, etc., and the amount of equipment purchased,
etc., are also considered secret. <i>Obviously, our agreement
with Messrs. Carl Zeiss cannot work satisfactorily unless,
at least the latter information, becomes common knowledge to
both parties, but some arrangement must be made whereby we
are assured this information will be kept in strictest confidence.</i>"

The accompanying report is headed "Statement of Military
Department to Mr. August Lomb, For the Months of April,
May and June 1929." It gave the number of antiaircraft range
finders, 26-1/2 ft. range finders, periscopes, telescopes, and bomb-*sights
which it had delivered and discussed the items for which
other bidders had been successful. Near the end of the report
was this paragraph:

"It will be noted from the foregoing statements that not
much information can be further obtained regarding competitive
prices. While these bids are supposed to be public, it has
lately become the practice to withhold the information from
the public. Every letter and envelope from the Government
is marked 'Confidential' and we are held accountable that the
information will not become public, and that it will be treated
in strictest confidence."

On December 20, 1932, Bausch and Lomb sent August
Lomb a letter marked Military Department 8430 and enclosed
a pamphlet dealing with submarine periscopes which he was to
give to Zeiss and make sure that it was returned to him and
by him to Bausch and Lomb. On the following day Bausch and
Lomb wrote Zeiss this letter:

"We confirm having written you the letter stated in the
above reference. The pamphlet referred to in it has been sent
to Mr. August Lomb, via registered mail.

"It occurs to us that we were not sufficiently specific regarding
the caution that must be exercised for our protection in
keeping the loan of this pamphlet a secret, and particularly as
regards the inspector. If any question should arise with regard
to the pamphlet which you are preparing, <i>please do not admit
to any one that this has been prepared analogous to our copy</i>.

"<i>By reason of the great importance which we attach to the
secrecy of this question, the copy has been sent via our Frankfurt
office, and please make sure that after it has served its purpose
it is again safely returned to our Mr. August Lomb.</i>"

The year 1933--the year Hitler became Chancellor--brought
a greatly enlivened interest on the part of Zeiss in the
military secrets of our country. The following is a translation
of a letter from Nedinsco to Bausch and Lomb dated April 7,
1933:

"Your last monthly report has given cause to the consideration
that we surely would be better in a position to assist you
<i>if you would report to us what kinds of instruments are under
trial and in use by your military service</i>. There must be a great
many questions regarding instruments for <i>airplanes, tanks, and
ships</i> which demand special optical instruments.

"We would ask that you intensively <i>find out at the proper
places and that you communicate to us the different problems</i>,
so that we are placed in a position to name you the necessary
instruments which we also make new to satisfy the actual demands.

"We believe that thereby the business could be enlivened
and also work could be created for you as well as us."

A month later on May 11, 1933 Nedinsco again wrote to
Bausch and Lomb as follows:

"We find, much to our regret, that the agreement during the
course of the last few years has materialized exclusively in
Rangefinders and Periscopes for the Navy and that also in this
respect it has lost more and more in intensity, whereas all other
instruments for Army and Navy have completely ceased.

"<i>It may be assumed with great probability that the many
other kinds of military instruments would find interest in the
United States and that there would be a demand for these so
that also for these there should be certain business chances.</i>

"Notwithstanding that we transmitted to you information regarding
many of our products, you have recently made a demand
upon us for our constructive help only to a very limited
extent.

"Business possibilities for foreign countries have never been
mentioned which may result from American credits to foreign
countries or from building contracts of American shipyards,
gun factories, etc., and for which you might be considered as
subcontractors. <i>Such business would according to Paragraph 3
of the agreement need a special understanding between us but
is not excluded.</i> In view of the extremely serious economic situation
in the world it would seem most urgent in our mutual interest
that we endeavor to bring about a more intensive co-*operation
between us in the frame of our agreement and we
therefore ask that you make known your position and make
proposals as to how far and in what manner these relations
could be furthered and the possibilities of business could be
more rationally exploited.

"<i>We would also be thankful for a comprehensive economic
report which would enable us to judge conditions.</i>"

It can hardly be mere coincidence that these repeated requests
for military information came so soon after Hitler's accession
to power.

On December 14, 1933 Bausch and Lomb wrote to August
Lomb as follows:

"We are sending you herewith our report which unfortunately
had to be delayed by reason of the pressure of work
which had to be taken care of in this department, due to the
sudden activity brought about by the N. R. A.

"<i>By reason of special secrecy clauses of late attached to each
bid and contract, these reports, as harmless as they are considering
that they have a commercial purpose only, are contrary
to these clauses. We cannot very well eliminate them under
the existing agreement with Carl Zeiss; however the regulations
are so stringent that particular care must be exercised to keep
these reports in strictest confidence and they should be kept
in a separate file under lock and key.</i>

"We would ask that you be governed accordingly and that
you bring these facts to the attention of Messrs. Carl Zeiss."

August Lomb answered this letter on December 29, 1933.
The first three paragraphs of his reply were as follows:

"Since writing you December 5th, your letter Nr. 8909 of
December 14th was received. It just arrived before the writer
went to Jena and could therefore be discussed there.

"<i>Monthly report.</i> That enclosed in your letter Nr. 8909 was
therefore transmitted personally, impressing again the <i>necessity
of considering this information strictly confidential and secret</i>.
This is fully understood by the management as well as their
Mil. Department and we <i>were again assured that these reports
are locked up and only accessible to a few people who are fully
responsible so that you can depend on your instructions being
carried out</i>.

"The contents of this report were very pleasing so far as the
important orders are concerned which you were able to secure.
It is to be regretted that the thirty-four 11 ft. R.F. were lost,
but evidently other firms also have to expect part of the business."

It would no doubt have been very reassuring to our War and
Navy Departments to know that these reports were "only accessible
to a few people" in Hitler's Germany.

On October 16, 1934 Bausch and Lomb wrote to August
Lomb as follows:

"We are very sorry to find that we neglected to send you
our report for a considerable length of time. <i>As you know,
we are not free to give you these reports.</i> This is about the best
excuse that we can offer; <i>the less reports we make the less the
chance of any going astray</i>.

"<i>We shall try to keep you informed more regularly having
your assurance that these matters will be treated by you and
Carl Zeiss in strictest confidence.</i>"

The report of October 16, 1934 entitled "Statement of Military
Department to Mr. August H. Lomb" lists the number
and kinds of range finders delivered each month and also the
total number of various types of instruments, orders for which
Bausch and Lomb has booked since their last report. There is
also the remark that they lost an order for four 13-1/2 ft. height
finders awarded to Keuffel and Esser (another American firm).
This report contains the following remarkable statement in
connection with designs for submarine periscopes:

"Our design force now consists of thirteen men all occupied
on present contracts so that it cannot be assumed that we want
to throw the burden of the design work on Carl Zeiss. <i>As a
matter of fact we could not do this under the secrecy clauses
of the 'Recovery Act,' but surely we ought to be able to rely
on Carl Zeiss for support when and where it is most important.</i>
We are hopeful that the promise made in letter of October 5
to give us this design by next spring can be considerably improved,
in fact that every effort will be made to bring the solution
of this problem to a point which will enable us to enter into
competition in the next bid."

On October 20, 1936 Bausch and Lomb wrote the following
letter to Carl Zeiss:

"With your letter in reference we received from you a new
optical layout in the form of your drawing A 33 08 65/Opt. L.
No. 2 for the altiperiscopes of 34 foot optical length.

"<i>We recently learned that our Government is now contemplating
the use of 40 foot submarine periscopes and that bids
for these will soon be submitted for consideration. These periscopes
will be built according to the identical specifications as
those you have in your possession with the exception that, as
already stated, the optical length has been increased from 34
feet to 40 feet and the reduced section has been increased in
length as shown on our drawing Mil. 458 sent herewith.</i> Moreover,
the inner diameter of the main body tube now measures
6,500 inches diameter for a distance of 11 feet from the eye-*piece
and while its remaining length has an inner diameter of
6.375 inches as shown on our drawing Mil. 458.

"We would ask that you kindly prepare for us immediately
a new optical layout conforming to these changes and that you
give us this information at the earliest possible date. As stated
this question will soon need our consideration and unless we
have the data available by that time we shall have to forego bidding
on this new proposition."

August Lomb realized the situation in which Bausch and
Lomb was placed in sending written reports of secret military
information to Germany. In a letter of July 9, 1937 to Bausch
and Lomb he made this very helpful suggestion:

"Prior to the years 1935 and 1936 Zeiss have always received
a list of numbers, kinds and prices of the instruments furnished
during one year when the commission statement for the respective
year was rendered. <i>Since 1935 such a statement was
not received, probably because you did not want to furnish any
such data in accordance with your letter Nr. 9383 of October
16th, 1934. Zeiss, however, would be satisfied with very brief
and condensed information, for instance Range Finders abbreviated
to R.F. etc., if possible.</i>

"Of course you will have to consider this with the Executive
Office and may let us know occasionally whether feasible or
not."

In a letter of March 24, 1939--the week after Hitler invaded
Czechoslovakia--Carl Zeiss made this demand upon
Bausch and Lomb:

"For this purpose it is <i>absolutely necessary</i>, and that is why
we ask you for it, <i>that you supply us</i>, before we arrive at our
final decision, with a <i>precise statement of those patents of ours
which you use in your manufacturing processes, designating at
the same time those instruments in whose manufacture these
patents are used, also indicating the turnover you have had in
these instruments during the last two business years, and the
volume of orders which you have at present on hand for such
instruments</i>.

"We take it for granted that your Administrative Division
can make up such a statement without trouble and loss of time
so that we <i>may expect it within a month at the latest</i>."

Instead of the detailed reports which had formerly been sent,
Bausch and Lomb complied with this demand by giving a
statement of the aggregate amount of sales of instruments covered
by Zeiss patents in 1937 and in 1938, designating the
patents. They stated they had orders for future delivery of
instruments covered by Zeiss patents totaling approximately
$1,000,000 and giving the patent numbers.

From the foregoing quotations it seems rather clear that
Bausch and Lomb put their own interpretation--and a strange
one--upon their obligation to keep military information secret
and confidential.

The supplemental agreement of June 27, 1925 contained
the following provision:

"In the case of inquiries, received by Bausch & Lomb from
authorities outside of the United States of America, by Carl
Zeiss from the authorities of the United States, one party informs
the other of the inquiry and is <i>obligated to make the protective
offer named by the other party. The increase of the
protective offer over the normal price for the corresponding
quantity of instruments in question shall not be higher than
20%.</i> Both parties are obligated to treat such inquiries as
promptly as possible. <i>If the party, that has made the protective
offer should, nevertheless, receive the order, it is obligated to
cede in full to the other firm the excess price representing the
protection.</i> The firm of Bausch & Lomb besides, has to pay to
the firm of Zeiss the royalty on the normal price according to
paragraph 2, in case Bausch & Lomb is awarded the order."

This arrangement served the purpose of making a governmental
authority--United States or some other--believe that
bona fide bids were being made in response to requests. Such
collusive bidding is a fraud upon the government and while a
similar provision was included in the supplemental agreement
of October 28, 1925, it was omitted from the agreement of
1926. And yet in 1932 there is evidence of willingness on
the part of Bausch and Lomb to be less than forthright in dealing
with the Navy Department. The following excerpt is
from a letter from Bausch and Lomb to Carl Zeiss dated February
24, 1932:

"From the copy of the above contract which we have sent
you with our other letter of today, Mil. Dept. 8077, you will
take notice that the contract provides that customs entry will
be taken care of by the Government. <i>In view of this, and in
order not to divulge to the Navy Department that we earn a
commission of 10% on this transaction, it will be necessary that
the consular invoices and export declarations which you will
have to make out be higher in this particular case than your net
invoice prices to us. Your shipping papers, consular invoices,
and export declarations, etc., accordingly should state the following
prices</i>, f.o.b. Venlo:

/*
<i>Item</i>                                   <i>Unit</i>    <i>Total</i>
1 --The unit price to be declared by
    you will be                          $7,400  $14,800.00
1a--The unit price to be declared by
    you will be                             470      470.00
2 --The unit price to be declared by
    you will be                           6,780   20,340.00
      (Note: The repeater motor is
        here included)
2a--The unit price to be declared by
    you will be                             470      940.00
*/

"The difference between the above prices and those stipulated
in the official contract are satisfactorily explained by shipping
expenses, etc.

"It goes without saying that you will bill us for these periscopes
in accordance with your letter of December 29, 1931
(N XIII/6661), less 10% commission."

The provisions of the 1921 and 1925 agreements prevented
Bausch and Lomb from selling to any purchaser outside the
United States unless such sale was approved by Zeiss. That the
omission of this provision from the agreement of 1926 did not
mean a change in policy is clearly shown by the following
memoranda exchanged by two Bausch and Lomb officials:

/*
"From: Mr. M. H. Eisenhart      Date: Jan. 11, 1927.
*/

"To: Mr. Edw. Bausch.

"I have read the following paragraph in August Lomb's letter
of December 20, 1926:

"'We note that you have decided to give up all military
work in connection with foreign countries, thus doing away
with the supplementary agreement of October 28th, 1925. Its
second paragraph on page 2 treats of instruments which you
might be called to supply for foreign vessels built or equipped
on American ship yards, as was the case for Argentine. We
understand that, as this entire agreement is now canceled, you
will renounce to bidding for such instruments hereafter.'

"Is it your understanding from this that in the future we
will not bid on any military instruments for use anywhere outside
of the United States? As this is a change over our present
procedure, I think we want to be sure of the definite understanding."

<tb>

/*
"From: Mr. E. Bausch      Reply      Date: Jan. 27, 1927.
*/

"To: Mr. M. H. Eisenhart

"It is my understanding, in accordance with the opinion of
Carl Lomb, that we are not to bid on any military instruments
for use anywhere outside of the U. S. The agreement is that
if such inquiries come to us we are to refer them to Zeiss. If,
on the other hand, any inquiries come to them which belong to
this territory, they are to be referred by them to us. A condition
may arise, as has been the case before, where a foreign
government might want to place an order with us, this to be
under supervision of Army and Navy officers and the inspection
as well. The procedure then would be--I should think--that
we defer giving any definite answer until we had submitted the
matter, according to agreement, to Zeiss, and await their disposition
of it."

The Edward Bausch who wrote the latter memorandum is
the same gentleman who was quoted in the <i>Literary Digest</i> of
December 12, 1936 in the following item:

"Millions of dollars of foreign Government orders for military
optical instruments have been rejected by the Bausch &
Lomb Co., of Rochester, New York, because they might conceivably
be used against the United States or its interests in
another War.

"Proudly last week, vigorous, eighty-two-year-old Dr. Edward
Bausch, founder and chairman, declared that to be his
company's settled policy, developed 'through a close understanding
with the Departments of the Army and the Navy
of our Government.'...

"Chiefly, Bausch & Lomb's rejected orders have been offered
by England and France, have been for range-finders, periscopes,
gun-sights, binoculars, artillery fire-control instruments. Business
from those two Governments would have exceeded $1,500,000.
Various smaller nations have also sought to make contracts
and have been refused. Self-sufficient Germany, however,
has shown no needs.

"<i>War-Time Seller</i>--During the World War, encouraged by
Washington, Bausch & Lomb made large sales to the Allies,
built up an extensive business with Great Britain. Promptly
with the reappearance of European war-scares several years
ago, however, the policy of no supplies to potential combatants
abroad was adopted. 'They are not prepared for war over
there,' a company officer gravely explained last week, 'and if
we refuse to help them prepare, it puts it off just that much.'"

In the documents taken from Bausch and Lomb's files there
are dozens of letters in which inquiries from foreign buyers of
military optical instruments were answered by Bausch and Lomb
with an expression of disinterest and a reference to Nedinsco.
On March 30, 1938 Bausch and Lomb wrote the British Military
Attache in Washington as follows:

"In reply to your letter of March 24, 1938 we wish to inform
you that the instruments that we manufacture for the
U. S. War Department are 4 meter Stereo Height Finders.

"Unfortunately we have to inform you that we are not in
a position to take British Government orders at the present
time."

On June 20, 1938 the International Standard Electric Corporation
of New York wrote Bausch and Lomb with regard
to procuring manufacturing equipment for its English associate,
Standard Telephone and Cables, Ltd., to manufacture certain
lenses and optical systems from British optical glass. After some
conferences and consideration, Bausch and Lomb wrote to International
Standard Electric Corporation on July 1, 1938 as
follows:

"One of the first steps I took in giving consideration to your
proposition which we discussed yesterday was to look into the
contractual arrangements to which we are already obligated
which I spoke to you about in my conversation.

"<i>Our attorneys tell us that we are absolutely tied up in a
way that will prevent our giving you the type of assistance you
need to get into the manufacture of optical fire control instruments.</i>
My thought was that events over the last few years had
changed our foreign relationship in a way that might allow
us to work with you, but I am definitely satisfied now that
such is not the case. Because of this situation, there is no need
for us to delay you any further in your plan.

"I enjoyed very much your visit here and perhaps at some
future occasion I may have the opportunity of meeting you
again."

In the October 1940 number of <i>Fortune Magazine</i> which
contained an article about Bausch and Lomb there was a
two-page spread devoted to "The Critical Geography of Industries
Essential to U. S. Rearmament." With reference to
optical goods, this statement appeared: "After aircraft engines,
armor plate, and machine tools this little industry (range finders,
aircraft height finders) stands fourth among defense bottlenecks."

There are undoubtedly many factors which contributed to
defense bottlenecks. It seems quite certain that the Zeiss-Bausch
and Lomb restrictive arrangement has had a substantial part in
bringing about this condition. There is no way of ascertaining
how many times competitors were intimidated by threats from
the combination of the two companies which were the largest
in the world. The following quotation is taken from a letter
from Bausch and Lomb to Carl Zeiss dated June 12, 1932 and
referring to a new order for Height Finders for which the
Frankford Arsenal was contemplating asking bids:

"Bids for this new prospective order have not yet been received
by us. It is at present our intention after the bids have
been received to <i>wait until a few days before the opening of
the bids</i> and then call the attention of the Keuffel & Esser
Company to the fact that we are controlling patent No. 1638190
which prohibits their furnishing the Height Finder in question.
<i>In this manner we hope to be able to make them afraid of
touching this business.</i> You will understand, therefore, how
anxious we are to receive your opinion that the arrangement of
four compensator wedges on one side of the Range [sic] Finder
infringes your patent."

The foregoing quotation indicates one of the reasons for the
arrangement by which all Zeiss inventions were to be patented
in the United States by Bausch and Lomb. There can be little
doubt that American patentees of competing military optical instruments
would have much more to fear in infringement litigation
initiated by the American firm of Bausch and Lomb than
would be the case if the real owner of the patents, the German
firm of Carl Zeiss, were the patentee. The other reason for
this arrangement was the fear that Zeiss-owned patents would
again be confiscated by the United States Government as had
been done in the first World War. For the two reasons and
possibly others it was clearly understood that all Zeiss inventions
patented in the United States should result in patents
issuing to Bausch and Lomb. What was just as clearly understood
was that at the expiration of their contract all these
patents were to be reassigned to Zeiss. This was stated in many
documents one of which, a letter from Bausch and Lomb to
Zeiss, dated January 17, 1936, should suffice to substantiate the
point.

"We have given consideration to the suggestions which you
have made for further clarification of the interpretations of the
existing contract which was the subject of our letter of October
14, 1935. We are, therefore, restating the points covered in
that letter, as follows:

[Par. 1 and 2 deals with termination of the contract]

"3. You are to assign to us all unexpired United States
patents and all pending applications for United States patents
in the military field now standing in your name or the name
of any company controlled by you through stock ownership or
otherwise, or in the name of any individual in the employ of
your company or any company so controlled by you. You are
also to assign to us all applications for patents in the military
field which are filed prior to October 31, 1940, on inventions
made by any individual or individuals employed by you or any
company so controlled by you. You are to file and prosecute
such applications and pay all expenses and fees therefor. With
respect to such pending and future applications we suggest that
you execute the proper assignment and send it to us as soon as
you receive the notice of allowance in an application. We will
promptly record the assignment in the United States Patent
Office and notify you so that you may pay the final fee in due
time so as to have the patent issued in our name as assignee. <i>We
shall assign to you or your nominee all your United States
patents or pending applications which have been taken out in
our name, or caused to be assigned to us under the provisions
of said agreement prior to April 30, 1941, reserving to ourselves
only the license to manufacture thereunder upon the
payment to you of the royalty as agreed under 2 hereinabove.</i>"

Field glasses or binoculars were expressly excepted from the
cartel arrangement between Zeiss and Bausch and Lomb. In
1931 Bausch and Lomb bid $39.50 each on a United States
Navy request for bids on 600 binoculars. Zeiss bid $26, and
this angered Bausch and Lomb to the extent that they brought
about a greatly increased tariff rate on imported binoculars.
The correspondence between the two firms over a period of
years refers to this episode. Edward Bausch of Bausch and
Lomb wrote to August H. Lomb in Frankfurt on November
18, 1932. The last two paragraphs of his letter are as follows:

"In all other departments we find the Zeiss competition
keen and aggressive. Zeiss have established themselves in this
country and have been for years making more and more intensive
efforts to get business. As an instance of their efforts we
will cite the circumstance of their having put in a bid for Field
Glasses to the government at such ridiculously low prices that
we cannot understand how there can be any profit in it for them,
but leaves us with a feeling that they are aiming to put us out
of competition and acquire the business for themselves.

"Such efforts as they are making in this territory will surely
lead to more aggressive action on our part and will certainly
lead to anything but friendly feeling, and ultimately, to a more
serious situation."

On February 6, 1934, Zeiss wrote Edward Bausch as follows:

"I received your letter of January 25, and at the same time,
a report from our Dr. Bauer about his interview with you and
your associates on January 15, 1934 in Rochester. First of all,
I wish to thank you for having gone to the trouble to write
down the sequence of events, which brought about the change
in duty calculation on our prism binoculars, with the result that
the duty, which will actually have to be paid, comes very close
to doubling the present rate. I expressed myself to Mr. Lomb
in a very general way, and had pointed out merely the effect
of the change of duty, which was probably caused by your
initiative, and I used the expression that the sixty per cent rate
had, in reality, been doubled.

"The essential consequence is that quality binoculars--and
only those of more than 5× magnification, and of foreign net
value of more than $12--have been affected by this measure.
In reality, only Zeiss Binoculars fall under this arrangement,
whereas all the cheap French prism binoculars, which are not
negligible in quantity, are exempt.

"From your letter, I have noted that the steps taken by you
were prompted by our offer and that of Carl Zeiss, New York,
of six hundred 6 × 30 prism binoculars at $26 each, which we
made in 1931 to the Navy. I believe that I do not have to
add anything to the explanations which our Dr. Bauer has given
you concerning this matter. The thought occurs to me, however,
whether it would not have been appropriate, in view of
the friendly and long relations between our respective houses,
if one of your gentlemen had communicated with our Dr.
Bauer and had pointed out the low prices to him in order to
bring about a satisfactory solution of the question for the future,
and this by means of a friendly understanding. Such an understanding
would have been readily possible at the time, for we
have always been ready to recognize justified wishes or requests
of other houses, especially of those friendly to us.

"I would consider it to our mutual interests if this duty
arrangement, which, as I admit frankly, has caused great bitterness
on our part, would disappear again. As you know from
several negotiations on other matters here and there, we and
Dr. Bauer are always ready for a price agreement, which protects
your just interests."

On February 28, 1935, Bausch and Lomb wrote to Dr.
Bauer of Carl Zeiss, Inc., New York. The first paragraph of
his letter is as follows:

"Although I enjoyed my visit with you last Saturday morning
very much, I have not been able to get out of my mind
your statement that you have not confidence in the younger
generation here in Rochester. Since this is predicated, I believe,
entirely upon the binocular situation, I just want to repeat
again what I told you in New York, that I believe whatever
action we took in regard to the tariff on binoculars was
prompted entirely by the fact that you bid a figure on a Navy
contract for binoculars which was absolutely out of reason and
made it look to us as if you were going to get this binocular
business from the United States Navy at any price. When we
saw there was no possibility of getting business from our own
Navy at a reasonable figure, we took the only step that was open
to us and made a complaint to one of our senators that started
a Senate Investigation and finally culminated in an executive
order that resulted in changing the method of figuring tariff
to the basis of American valuation."

On March 8, 1935, K. A. Bauer of Carl Zeiss, Inc., wrote
Bausch and Lomb. The first three paragraphs of his letter are
as follows:

"I thank you for your letter of February 28, referring to
our conversation of February 23rd. I wish to correct your impression
of my having made the general statement 'that I
have no confidence in the younger generation in Rochester.' I
said: 'How can we have confidence, that an agreement regarding
Contact glasses--if possible at all--will turn out satisfactorily,
after the experience we had in the binocular matter?'
I also said that under the management of the older generation,
such a thing, as this binocular case turned out to be, would not
have been possible. But I do not wish these words to be
generalized to the above blunt statement, and I am sorry, if I
may not have expressed myself clearly enough.

"Now turning to the binocular matter, you know that I have
had conversations with your firm in which I found a certain
degree of understanding for the untenability of the present
tariff situation and a willingness not to resist a reasonable
solution. Due to the political constellation and to tariff negotiations
pending in Washington with other countries, the flexible
tariff clause is at present petrified and nobody can say, when
this may change. In the meantime, importation of highgrade
binoculars continues to be impossible. As long as this condition
lasts, we shall naturally feel irritated and we cannot but resent
the fact that it was brought about by methods which we must
condemn. The nature of the tariff action was camouflaged by
the wording of the Senate Resolution, in order to deceive the
importers of prism binoculars. We ourselves as well as other
importers were deprived of what little right we had under the
tariff law to state our side. If you personally have any doubt
as to who engineered this whole affair, I suggest that you read
the stenographic report of the so-called 'Public Hearing'
which took place in Washington on October 18, 1932.

"You say that we quoted on 600 binoculars 6 × 30 such a
low price that it was 'out of reason.' Admitted that our price
of $26--was low. Your quotation of $39.50, however, seems
to be exorbitant. It is also true that the quality specified by
the Navy was of a higher grade than that of commercial binoculars.
But this fact is more than compensated by the large number
of 600 glasses involved, which were to be manufactured,
shipped and delivered at one time to one party, whose credit is
beyond doubt. The large number called for a special low price.
Instead you quoted to the U. S. Navy--your best single customer--considerably
more than what you asked from a dealer
for one single glass. At that time you sold your 6 × 30 model
(with central focusing device) at $66 list, and at $35.18 and
even at $33 net to the trade; a few months later at even lower
prices. If you deduct from these prices an adequate amount for
the central focusing device, which the Navy did not require,
your net trade price for one single 6 × 30 binocular with individual
focusing would have come rather close to our price of
$26. What difference remained might have been cut down
further by the quantity factor as explained above. Had your
firm quoted as one should have expected, considering all that
has been said above, we would have had no chance whatever to
get the order under the Budget Law even at a lower price. In
our opinion you bid too high, expecting that under the Budget
Law you would have the monopoly anyhow."

One recalls the urgent plea which was made about the time
of Pearl Harbor for all private citizens to make gifts of their
binoculars for use by the armed service. To the extent that a
shortage of such material can be traced to the squabbles among
cartelists it is a condition which should certainly never be
allowed to recur.

One of the most serious problems which will confront our
government and the United Nations in connection with the
termination of the war with Germany is that of eliminating for
the future the German war machine. The relations of Carl
Zeiss and Bausch and Lomb show what may be expected when
private business concerns are permitted to handle such a problem
as though it were a matter of private concern. Surely it is
to be hoped that the policy of our government as expressed in
the peace which will be made with Germany will not be rendered
ineffectual because of the private international policy of
certain business concerns. The decree of July 9, 1940, enjoined
Bausch and Lomb from further carrying out any of the provisions
of its agreements with Carl Zeiss. This alone is not
sufficient to insure that the public policy expressed by government
action shall not be thwarted by the machinations of private
cartels.

<i>Miscellaneous Products</i>


Three recent cases illustrate some interesting characteristics
of the cartel problem. These cases--involving cartelization of
pharmaceutical products, chemicals, firearms and ammunition,
and matches--include industrial concerns and individuals in
Germany, England, Canada, Sweden, Chile, the Argentine, and
Brazil. They are significant not only because of their inherent
character, but also because the war has not materially affected
their operation. True, the war forced certain changes upon
them, but these were modifications, not cessations.

Since the cases in question had not been legally adjudicated
at the time this was written, it is well for the reader to remember
that the statements which follow are allegations which were
a matter for litigation between the government and the various
defendants.

On October 28, 1943, the Department of Justice filed a complaint
charging Merck & Co., Inc., of Rahway, N. J., the largest
producer of pharmaceutical chemicals in the United States, and
E. Merck Chemical Works, of Darmstadt, Germany, with
maintaining a cartel agreement in violation of the antitrust
laws.

Named as defendants in the suit were Merck & Co.; George
W. Merck, President of the firm; and Powers-Weightman-Rosengarten
Corp., a Merck subsidiary. The complaint charged
that:

(1) The Rahway firm and its subsidiary conspired with the
Darmstadt concern to divide world territory into non-competitive
areas by means of what they themselves describe as a
"Treaty," dated November, 1932.

(2) Under the terms of this "Treaty," the Rahway firm was
assigned the United States and Canada as exclusive territory,
while the Darmstadt organization was assigned almost all the
rest of the world. The "Treaty" also provided that Cuba, the
West Indies and the Philippines were joint territory in which
conditions of sale and prices were fixed by agreement.

(3) Since the British blockade after outbreak of the war in
1939 prevented the Darmstadt firm from exporting to many
foreign countries, particularly to Latin America, it was agreed
that the American company would supply Darmstadt's agents
in South America but that the territorial provisions of the 1932
"Treaty" remained in effect, with Latin American markets returned
to Merck of Darmstadt as exclusive territory after the
war.

(4) To carry out this agreement Merck of Rahway revived
a dormant subsidiary, Powers-Weightman-Rosengarten Corporation,
to engage during the war in export business in territory
assigned exclusively to Merck-Darmstadt. The purpose of
using this dormant subsidiary was to enable Merck of Rahway
more easily to abandon its export business in Darmstadt's territory
after the war.

(5) Merck of Rahway not only intends to abandon all its
export business in Darmstadt's territory after the war but to
continue the territorial division provided in the 1932 "Treaty"
until 1982.

(6) The agreement covers approximately 400 pharmaceuticals
and chemicals, including quinines, sulfa drugs, vitamines,
narcotics and mercurials.

The government charges specifically that prior to the last
war there were close ties between Merck of Rahway and Merck-Darmstadt
which were dissolved in 1919 by the Alien Property
Custodian. During the last war the American Merck company
gained a large export business in chemicals and pharmaceuticals
in Central and South America only to relinquish this business
and allow it to be recaptured by Merck-Darmstadt after
the war.

In 1932, the two companies entered into understandings and
agreements to divide world markets into exclusive areas, and as
a device to conceal these arrangements they entered into a so-called
"Treaty Agreement" on November 17, 1932, for a period
of 50 years. The German and American Merck companies,
it is charged, divided the use of the "Merck" trade name and
the sales of their products throughout the world. Under this
arrangement, the right to sell exclusively in the United States
and Canada was assigned to Merck of Rahway, which was also
permitted to sell jointly with Merck-Darmstadt in Cuba, the
West Indies and the Philippines. The rest of the world became
the exclusive sales territory of the German company.

In making the above charges, the Government asked the
Court to dissolve the 1932 "Treaty Agreement"; to cancel the
exclusivity of licenses to use certain patents of the German firm;
to enjoin Merck of Rahway from refusing to fill orders from
established chemical and pharmaceutical dealers in foreign
countries; and to enjoin the American firm from vesting any
patent rights in the German company at any future time without
first notifying the Attorney General of its intention to make
such patent transfer; and to prevent the parties from entering
any similar agreements or arrangements.

<tb>

On January 6, 1944, the Department of Justice filed a complaint
charging two American companies, a British company,
the American agent of the British company, and five of their
officers, with maintaining an international cartel agreement to
restrain trade in the manufacture of chemical products, firearms,
and ammunition, in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act.

Named as defendants in the suit were: E. I. du Pont de
Nemours and Company, Inc., Wilmington, Delaware, including
Lammot du Pont, Chairman of the Board, Walter Samuel
Carpenter, Jr., President; Remington Arms Company, Inc.,
Bridgeport, Connecticut, including Charles Krum Davis, President
and General Manager; Imperial Chemical Industries,
Ltd., London, England, including Harry Duncan McGowan,
Chairman of the Board, and Henry Mond, Deputy Chairman;
and Imperial Chemical Industries (New York), Ltd., New
York City, American agent of ICI.

The government charged that beginning sometime prior to
1920 du Pont, ICI and, from 1933, Remington, had been engaged
in a conspiracy and combination in restraint of trade and
commerce in chemical products, arms, including war materials,
and ammunition in the United States and with foreign nations,
and were parties to contracts and agreements in violation of the
Sherman Antitrust Act.

The alleged conspiracy consisted of an agreement, the terms
of which were:

(1) That du Pont and ICI not compete with each other.

(2) That du Pont, Remington and ICI cooperate to eliminate
competition between Remington and ICI.

(3) That du Pont and ICI each be assigned certain marketing
areas as exclusive territory.

(4) That the defendants agree to eliminate competition between
themselves in non-exclusive territory by various arrangements,
including the formation of joint companies, to sell their
products in accordance with agreed quotas and prices.

(5) That du Pont and ICI exchange exclusive licenses under
all patents and processes for the exclusive territories allocated
to each, and non-exclusive licenses for the remainder of the
world.

(6) That du Pont and ICI attempt to obtain for each other
the benefit of agreements and understanding arrived at with
third parties for allocation of world markets or the acquisition
of technological developments.

(7) That du Pont and ICI cooperate to eliminate the competition
of other companies throughout the world.

The agreement was estimated to affect thousands of products,
ranging from explosives to paints and varnishes. Du Pont is the
largest manufacturer of chemical products in the United States,
with total assets approximately one billion dollars, including the
ownership of approximately 23 per cent of the stock of General
Motors Corporation. Remington is described as the largest
manufacturer of sporting arms and ammunition in the United
States, and since 1933 has been controlled by du Pont.

Imperial Chemical Industries, which has a virtual monopoly
of the chemical industry in Great Britain, was formed as the
result of a merger of four major British companies, and it was
contended that ICI's founders intended not only to gain a
monopoly of the chemical industry in the United Kingdom but
to join with the other major manufacturers of chemicals
throughout the world, including I. G. Farbenindustrie of Germany
and du Pont, to safeguard such monopoly position. This
policy was explained by ICI to du Pont as follows:

"Sir Harry explained that the formation of I.C.I. is only the
first step in a comprehensive scheme which he has in mind to
rationalize chemical manufacture in the world. The details of
such a scheme are not worked out, not even in Sir Harry's own
mind, but the broad picture includes working arrangements between
three groups--the I. G. in Germany, Imperial Chemical
Industries in the British Empire, and du Pont and the Allied
Chemical & Dye in America. The next step in the scheme is an
arrangement of some sort between the Germans and the British."

Imperial Chemical Industries (New York) conducts no independent
business operations of its own but acts solely as agent
for ICI for the transaction of business in the United States. The
complaint stated that in 1935 the then president of ICI (New
York) described the corporation as the "private commercial
legation" of ICI.

Sometime prior to 1920 du Pont and ICI came to an understanding
with each other for the elimination of competition in
the sale of explosives in all parts of the world. By this understanding
du Pont was allocated the United States and Central
America as its exclusive sales territory, and ICI was allocated
the balance of the world, with the exception of Canada, Newfoundland
and South America. Both companies were to refrain
from manufacture in or export to each other's exclusive markets,
while Canada, Newfoundland and South America were to be
shared by both companies on a non-competitive basis.

It was further agreed that profits from the sale of commercial
explosives in South America would be divided equally; and that
in Canada the firm of Canadian Industries, Ltd., jointly owned
by both, would be utilized to eliminate competition between
them. Moreover, it was agreed that du Pont and ICI would exchange
exclusive licenses under all their present and future
patents, processes and inventions for use in the exclusive territory
of each, and that non-exclusive licenses would be exchanged
for the territories shared by both companies.

By 1925, however, Dynamit Aktiengesellschaft (known as
DAG), a German corporation, had begun to offer serious competition
to du Pont and ICI in all important world markets,
and in that year the two companies reached an agreement with
DAG to eliminate competition in commercial explosives. By
this understanding, DAG agreed to abstain from doing business
in certain markets and to adhere to quota arrangements in other
markets including South America. For this agreement, DAG
was awarded as its exclusive market in commercial explosives
Germany, Holland, Poland, Austria, Denmark and Bulgaria.
Du Pont and ICI also subsequently acquired a stock interest in
DAG.

In order to carry out the understanding, it was charged, du
Pont, ICI and DAG about 1925, organized Explosives Industries,
Ltd., incorporated under the laws of the United Kingdom.
Du Pont and ICI were each allocated 37-1/2 per cent of its shares,
and DAG 25 per cent; and the parties agreed to conduct all
their exports in explosives to South America through this corporation.
Exports to Chile and Bolivia were not included, however,
as du Pont and ICI had earlier organized a jointly-owned
company, Compania Sud-Americana de Explosives, to import
and manufacture explosives in Bolivia and Chile.

At the time du Pont and ICI entered into the conspiracy, it
was asserted, they were primarily explosives manufacturers, but
both continually increased the number of products manufactured
until explosives became but one of many items. The growth of
the combination paralleled the grow of the two companies; as
each company made new products, they were brought into the
conspiracy.

The complaint cited as an example of the functioning of the
conspiracy that during the period 1920-29, du Pont tried to
protect ICI from the competition of American cartridge companies
by withdrawing from these companies discounts and rebates
in connection with the sale of powder so that they might
not disrupt ICI's markets by cutting prices.

By 1929 the conspiracy had incorporated substantially all of
the products then made by du Pont and ICI, and the complaint
alleged that in 1929 a further agreement was entered into
whereby all products other than explosives would be handled in
the British Empire by ICI and in the United States and Central
America by du Pont. It was further agreed that as to the balance
of the world, the two companies would enter into special
arrangements to eliminate competition and would explore the
desirability of utilizing joint companies. Later, two joint companies
were founded to handle products in Argentina and Brazil--Industrias
Quimicas Argentinas "Duperial," S. A., and Industrias
Chimicas Brazeileiras "Duperial," S. A.

Military explosives had been omitted from the 1929 agreement,
as the two companies continued to make certain special
arrangements to eliminate competition between them. After
1933, when Remington joined the conspiracy, the complaint
states that further contracts and agreements were entered into
to eliminate competition between ICI and Remington in the
manufacture and sale of ammunition and sporting arms.

The parties clearly understood that they would continue the
relationship between them irrespective of governmental action
which might affect the concerns. In July, 1933, Lord McGowan
wrote to Lammot du Pont as follows:

"I have warned my people that no fiscal alterations in the
U. S. A. must be allowed to affect the interpretation to be
placed on our Patents and Processes Agreement, and the working
out of the co-operation for which the Agreement provides....
I find it is a good thing to issue such warnings ... so that
everything possible is done to ensure that no prospective political
or legislative action on the part of Governments is permitted
to influence relations between du Pont and ICI."

To this letter, Mr. du Pont replied in part: "I feel the same;
... If any legislation or international agreements are brought
about which affect these ICI-du Pont relations, I am sure we
will be able to adjust ourselves so as to get the continued benefit
of our Agreement."

The agreement of 1929 was to expire in June, 1939, and at
that time ICI and du Pont entered into another agreement for
10 years and indefinitely thereafter. The territorial provisions
were continued, and in addition to the patents and products covered
by the 1929 agreement, numerous other products were
added, including cellulose compounds, alkali metals and their
products, fertilizers, dyestuffs, synthetic resins and plastics, perfumes,
flavoring compounds, pharmaceutical chemicals, and new
synthetic products, including rubber, nylon and neoprene.

The Government charged that competition was restrained
successfully by means of the joint companies in Canada, Argentina
and Brazil, pointing out that because I. G. Farben was
encroaching on the field in Argentina, certain arrangements
were made for a further joint company to be partly controlled
by Farben. However, because of the war this procedure was
not carried out, although du Pont's Foreign Relations Department
stated in February, 1940, that "the du Pont Company
informed I. G. that they intended to use their good offices after
the war to have the I. G. participation restored."

The purpose of the Government's suit was to bring about the
abrogation of the illegal contracts, to secure a perpetual injunction
against ICI from violating the American Antitrust Acts,
and to require du Pont and ICI to take further steps to prevent
future use of joint companies.

<tb>

On May 1, 1944, the Department of Justice filed a complaint
charging the maintenance of an international cartel in
the manufacture and distribution of matches, in violation of the
Sherman Antitrust Act, by six American companies, two British
companies, a Canadian company, a Swedish company, two
American agents of the Swedish company, and six of their officers.

Named as defendants in the suit were: Diamond Match Company,
New York City (including William A. Fairburn, President,
and Howard F. Holman, Vice-President); Berst-Forster-Dixfield
Company, New York City (including Robert G. Fairburn,
President); William Gordon Corporation, New York
City; Universal Match Corporation, St. Louis, Missouri; Ohio
Match Company, New York City; Lion Match Company, Inc.,
New York City; British Match Corporation, Limited, London,
England (including Sir Clarence Bartholomew, Managing Director);
Bryant & May, Limited, London, England; Eddy
Match Company, Limited, Pembroke, Ontario, Canada; Svenska
Tändsticks Aktiebolaget (Swedish Match Company), Jön-*köpings,
Sweden; Transamerican Match Corporation, New
York City (including Fritz Otterberg, President); New York
Match Co., Inc., New York City, American agents of Swedish
Match Company (including Paul Bertil Lind, President).

The Government's complaint made the following charges:

(1) A cartel comprising American, Swedish, British, and Canadian
match producers eliminated competition throughout the
world in the manufacture and distribution of matches. This
cartel has been in existence since 1901.

(2) The defendants divided world territories into non-competing
areas, established production and sales quotas, and restricted
the production of matches in the major markets of the
world.

(3) The defendants suppressed inventions and improvements
in the match art. By the acquisition of patents controlling the
"repeating" or "everlasting" match, the defendants have been
able virtually to suppress its production and use.

(4) Defendants controlled patents, raw materials, chemicals,
machinery, and processes in order to maintain their grip on the
industry and prevent competitive capital from entering the
market.

(5) The defendants acquired competing match producers and
distributors wherever and whenever competition threatened.

(6) The amounts of matches imported into the United States
from Sweden, Russia, and Japan have been curtailed and prices
have been fixed by agreement with the Diamond Match Company
with the approval of the other American defendants. Imports
into the United States from Canada, the British Empire,
and other markets of the world have been virtually eliminated.

(7) As part of the conspiracy, match factories in the United
States have been withdrawn from production and scrapped.

(8) As the result of agreements between the Diamond Match
Company and I. G. Farbenindustrie, American production of
chlorate of potash, essential to match production and certain
types of ammunition, was virtually halted during the period between
the first World War and the second World War. This
conspiracy resulted in a grave shortage of chlorate of potash for
military purposes and match production.

(9) Post-war plans have already been made by the defendants
to resume the conspiracy in full as soon as the difficulties
created by the war disappear.

The conspiracy in the world match industry against which the
complaint was directed was reinforced by an agreement entered
into in 1920 by Ivar Kreuger, the late so-called "match king,"
and William Fairburn on behalf of their respective companies,
the Swedish Match Company and the Diamond Match Company.

These two companies are the major factors in the match
industry of the world. The Swedish Match Company is the
world's largest match producer and exporter. The Diamond
Match Company is the largest American match producer. Diamond,
through its President, William A. Fairburn, and his
personal holding company, the William Gordon Corporation,
dominates and controls the policies of Diamond's partly-owned
and affiliated company, Berst-Forster-Dixfield Company, and
the Universal Match Corporation, Ohio Match Company, and
Lion Match Company, Inc.; these companies together with
Diamond, produce approximately 83 per cent of American
matches. The annual sales of matches in the United States are
in excess of $40,000,000.

Prior to the first World War, Diamond was the exclusive
agent for Swedish Match for the sale in the United States, Canada,
Cuba, and Puerto Rico of safety matches, the type most
widely used by the armed forces. When Swedish imports to the
United States were cut off during the first World War, Diamond,
in 1917, erected a large safety match factory at Savannah,
Georgia, to supply the urgent needs of the armed forces
of the United States and its allies and civilian requirements for
this kind of match.

After the first World War, Kreuger threatened vigorous
competition with Diamond in the United States. Faced with
this threat, Diamond and Swedish Match entered into an arrangement
in 1920 described by Diamond's President, William
A. Fairburn, as the "peace treaty with the Swedes." Under the
"peace treaty" Swedish Match appointed Diamond its exclusive
agent in the United States for the sale of Swedish safety matches
and agreed to discontinue all other selling agencies and establishments
in the United States. In order to assure Swedish
Match of its share of the American match market, it is charged,
Kreuger and Fairburn entered into a secret agreement which
required Diamond to destroy virtually its entire safety match
business, including the scrapping of its largest plant at Savannah,
Georgia. Swedish Match agreed that it would not otherwise
make or sell matches on the North American Continent;
Diamond, in turn, agreed not to make or sell matches in countries
supplied by Swedish Match.

The understandings reached in 1920 between Diamond and
Swedish Match are still in effect, although the limitation of
production feature has been temporarily suspended. Upon the
outbreak of the present war a match shortage, particularly of
the safety match type, resulted in the United States and in certain
South and most Central American countries. In accordance
with the agreement between the parties the South and Central
American markets were Swedish territory. But war conditions
have made it impossible for Swedish Match to supply this market.
Instead of selling directly in these markets, however, Diamond,
through its controlled affiliate, Berst-Forster-Dixfield,
supplied Swedish Match with matches for South and Central
American countries. The condition for Diamond's policy in
thus helping out was expressed to Swedish Match as follows:

"We help you now. You stay out of the United States market
after the war."

By 1927 Kreuger became dissatisfied with the share of Swedish
Match and its affiliated company, International Match, in
the American match market. In violation of the "peace treaty,"
he planned to erect new match factories and acquire existing
concerns in the United States. William A. Fairburn, on behalf
of Diamond, successfully appeased Kreuger for the time being
by acquiring Ohio Match, then the second largest domestic
match producer, and selling Kreuger a half interest in the company.
By 1931 Kreuger, through an arrangement with Fairburn,
acquired a one-third interest in Diamond itself. At the
same time, Fairburn induced Kreuger to scrap a partly-constructed
match factory at Natchez, Mississippi.

In 1901, the complaint charges, Diamond and Bryant & May,
virtually the sole match producer in Great Britain, came to an
understanding for the elimination of competition between them.
Thereafter Bryant & May refrained from producing and selling
matches in the United States and Diamond in the British Empire.
It is also charged that the Berst-Forster-Dixfield, Universal,
Ohio, and Lion companies have followed Diamond's
policies with regard to non-competitive relations with Swedish
Match, Bryant & May, and the other corporate defendants.

About 1927 Bryant & May and Swedish Match eliminated
competition in the British home market (the United Kingdom
and Ireland) and the remainder of the British Empire. Fifty-five
per cent of the match consumption of the United Kingdom
and Ireland was allotted by Bryant & May's domestic production;
the remaining 45 per cent was allotted to Swedish Match's
imports. India was allocated to Swedish Match and the remainder
of the British Empire to Bryant & May. To effectuate
the division of markets, British Match Corporation was formed
in 1927 as a holding company, and acquired all of the stock of
Bryant & May. Swedish Match obtained 30 per cent of the
stock of British Match.

In 1927, it is asserted, Diamond, Bryant & May, and Swedish
Match eliminated competition in Canada by the formation of
Eddy Match, which acquired virtually all of the match factories
in that country.

In 1935, after consultation with and approval by Diamond,
Swedish Match, by agreement with the Japanese producers and
the Soviet Match Monopoly, fixed the price of and limited
match imports into the United States from Japan and Soviet
Russia. In about 1937 Diamond became the exclusive agent
for all Russian and Japanese matches sold in the United States.

The complaint alleges that about 1922 Diamond's wholly-owned
subsidiary, Uniform Chemical Products, became exclusive
agent in the United States for the sale of I. G. Farbenindustrie's
German-made chlorate of potash. Chlorate of potash
is a chemical not only essential in match manufacture, but also
in the production of ammunition, flares, and railway emergency
warning signals. In return for Uniform's exclusive agency, I. G.
Farbenindustrie required Diamond virtually to cease the manufacture
of chlorate of potash in the United States. As a result
of the scrapping of American plants, this country had practically
no plant capacity for the production of chlorate of potash at the
outbreak of the war. Emergency plant construction has not yet
overcome the shortage of this essential chemical.

The complaint recites the heretofore undisclosed history of
the so-called "everlasting" match, which has long been a matter
of considerable rumor and speculation. About 1932, it is
charged, Kreuger obtained control of the patents on this match,
and subsequently Bryant & May obtained an interest in them.
Diamond later was offered a participation in Swedish Match's
patents and also negotiated with the inventor of certain improvements.
Although it was commercially successful in Holland
and Switzerland, the everlasting match has never been
manufactured commercially by Diamond or any other American
manufacturer. Diamond's decision not to acquire the patents
and manufacture the everlasting match was expressed as follows
in a document found in their files: "The patents have not
so long to run and if it becomes a marketable commodity by our
pushing it, once the patents are out--as in the case of book-*matches--it
would be a fertile field for the rottenest kind of
competition. It is to be hoped that if the item is not put out and
pushed by a strong manufacturer, no one else will take it up
even if the patents expire."

The Government sought, among other things, the abrogation
of the illegal contracts and agreements and a perpetual injunction
against the defendants, prohibiting them from violating
the Sherman Antitrust Act. The Government also asked that
Diamond, Berst-Forster-Dixfield, and the William Gordon
Corporation be required to divest themselves of holdings in
any other match producer, including the foreign corporate defendants.

<i>The Webb Act</i>


An expanding foreign trade is one of our chief economic objectives.
Both Government and business should desire and promote
policies that will open up new markets to American enterprise,
encourage sound foreign investment and facilitate the
flow of goods between this and other countries. There can be no
issue, surely, over this basic purpose. Nor is there room for
disagreement on the proposition that a crucial, if not indeed the
ultimate, test of our economic policy should be its efficacy in
promoting free enterprise as opposed to a controlled economy.
Differences, if any, relate only to methods.

However, anyone who has been under the impression that
the Webb Act provides an easy backdoor entrance for American
firms to join forces with cartels seeking domination and control
of world markets is in for sad disillusionment. The Webb Act
was intended to strengthen American competition against foreign
cartels. It was enacted by Congress in the belief that it
would provide a means of assistance to American business in
combatting the power of foreign cartels dominating world markets.
The Act was not passed to permit American firms to take
part in cartel restrictions on American trade--such restrictions
are directly contrary to Congressional purpose.

It should be emphasized that associations organized under
the Webb Act cannot legally enter into international agreements
which restrict production and distribution, divide territories and
fields of operation, fix prices or other wise regiment industry
throughout the world. Neither can they legally enter into
agreements which restrain trade within the United States, restrain
the export trade of any domestic competitor or association,
or which enhance or depress prices or substantially lessen
competition within the United States.

We have instituted a suit against the United States Alkali
Export Association, the California Alkali Export Association
and others, charging them with maintaining international cartel
agreements to restrain trade in the manufacture and distribution
of alkalis in violation of the Sherman Act. In this case we have
charged that activities by the defendants were not authorized by
the Webb Act. I shall refer later to this case in more detail.
It is sufficient to say at this point that other associations are under
investigation for similar activity, and that new antitrust
suits will be instituted whenever evidence discloses illegal activity
by export associations or others.

The alkali suit may very well have prompted the resolution
of the Board of Directors of the the Commerce and Industry
Association of New York to declare that Congress should restudy
the Webb Act and by proper amendments bring it up to
date so that there can be achieved under it all of the objectives
that President Wilson sought to attain when he procured the
enactment of this Act in 1918. The resolution recited that the
Department of Justice program for enforcement of the Sherman
Act seemed to be seeking to impose the competitive system and
the antitrust philosophy, as interpreted by the United States
Supreme Court, on other countries, and implied that antitrust
enforcement was frustrating the purposes of the Webb Act.
And in other quarters it has been suggested that perhaps the
Webb Act provides a vehicle for attaining cartel objectives
without incurring the penalties of the Sherman Act.

These suggestions that the enforcement of the Sherman Act
in the field of foreign trade somehow constitutes a betrayal of
the Congressional policy embodied in the Webb Act, and that
the Webb Act legalizes restrictive cartel practices, are based
upon a misconception of the meaning and purpose of the Act.
The Webb Act was enacted to help American business compete
with foreign cartels. It was not passed to provide a conduit for
joining them. It was designed to stimulate the position of
American concerns as competitors for world trade and to stimulate
the growth of our export trade. The Act created only a
very limited exemption from the Sherman Act which I shall
presently discuss.

But, before taking up the Act itself, let us look at the conditions
which brought about its enactment. The background of
the Act is set forth extensively in a report by the Federal Trade
Commission, dated June 30, 1916, on cooperation in American
export trade. This report set forth that other nations had certain
advantages in foreign trade because of superior facilities and
more effective organizations; it pointed out that doubt and fear
as to legal restrictions prevented Americans from developing
effective organizations for engaging in international trade, and
that as a result the smaller concerns suffered because of their
lack of organization and facilities. It emphasized that in seeking
business abroad, American manufacturers and producers had
to meet aggressive competition from powerful foreign combinations
often international in character. It recited that in some
industries the smaller manufacturers had to compete abroad
with great American companies having much more efficient
worldwide selling organizations. In order to assist these smaller
businesses to acquire proper facilities for doing an international
business, and to enable them to meet the competition in prices
and services of major American concerns and all foreign competitors,
the report recommended that small American producers
and manufacturers should be permitted to unite their
efforts for purposes of conducting foreign trade. By combining
their efforts it was thought that these small firms would be
better able to advertise, maintain an adequate selling force, and
create markets abroad.

But, while recognizing the desirability of a certain degree of
cooperation in seeking international markets, the Federal Trade
Commission in its 1916 report was fully cognizant of the possibility
of misuse of export associations and of the necessity to
prevent their misuse by legislative safeguards and antitrust
enforcement. Thus the Commission said:

"Two chief dangers from cooperation export organizations
of American manufacturers and producers are apparent. They
may be used to exploit the home market and they may be used
unfairly against individual American exporters in foreign trade.
The dangers in cooperative action must be faced frankly and
provided against fully.

"The Commission is confident that this can be done without
sacrificing the essential advantages of joint action and without
altering the policy of the antitrust laws or interfering with their
enforcement."

And the Commission further declared that "This recommendation
is made subject to the condition that the legislation shall
be carefully safeguarded and shall make absolutely clear that
the combinations for export business are subject to all of the
rigors of the Sherman law if they are used to restrain trade in
the United States."

Bills were then introduced in Congress by Senator Pomerene
and Congressman Webb, and were considered by Congressional
committees and debated from 1916 to 1918, when the law was
enacted. The Webb Act as finally passed provides that nothing
in the Sherman Act shall be construed as declaring to be illegal
an export association or any agreement made or act done in the
course of export trade by such association, provided that such
association, agreement or act does not: (a) restrain trade within
the United States; or (b) restrain the export trade of any domestic
competitor or association; or (c) enhance or depress
prices within the United States, substantially lessen competition
within the United States, or otherwise restrain trade therein.

Since the Webb Act is a statute creating an exception to the
Sherman Act's general application, the principle of interpretation
governing all statutes which create such exceptions must be
applied here; that is, the Webb Act must be strictly construed.
It must not be taken to cover any more ground than appears to
have been intended by the language of the Act itself read in the
light of the legislative history.

The legislative history leaves no doubt whatever as to what
Congress intended. In its report of May 11, 1917, the House
Judiciary Committee stated:

"The bill is drawn so as to leave in full force our antitrust
laws as applied to our own markets and as affecting different
American exporters in their dealings with each other.... The
bill does not authorize any violation of the present antitrust
laws.... The bill prohibits the slightest violation of our antitrust
laws within the United States."

The Senate Committee report contained a similar declaration.

The House and Senate debates abound with declarations by
the sponsors of the bill that it did not in any way interfere with
the application of the Sherman Act to the domestic commerce
of the United States and to agreements to restrain the export
trade of competitors of the associations. In referring to antitrust
jurisdiction over proposed export associations, Representative
Webb stated: "If the combination for export trade affects
unduly or artificially the prices in the United States then they
come within the Sherman Antitrust Law."

Senator Pomerene made the following significant arguments
during debate on the bill:

"The position was taken in substance that this bill was a repeal
of the Sherman Antitrust Law, and if it became the law of
the land and these associations were authorized they would at
once seek to control the foreign market and probably enter into
a combination with foreign companies and cartels engaged in the
same line of business and thus reenforced and worldwide in their
control of products they would reduce the prices of food animals,
of grain, and of other products and raise the prices to the
consumer when it suited their purposes."

"If the Senator when making this argument had recited facts
instead of fancies, there might have been some force in his utterances
but he was giving free reign to his imagination. The
Senator overlooked the fact that this bill does not repeal the
Sherman Law. He had in mind one paragraph only and lost
sight of all the restrictions and qualifications it contains. I submit
that when this bill is construed judicially it will be analyzed
as a whole and not one part separate from the other.

"The Senator forgets that neither the associations, nor their
agreements, nor their actions can be in restraint of trade within
the United States, nor in restraint of the foreign trade of any
domestic competitor and they cannot by any agreement, conspiracy,
or act artificially or intentionally and unduly either
enhance prices or reduce prices domestically, and if they do they
violate the law of the land."

During the debates some members of Congress, foreseeing
the possibility that export associations might join in a combination
with foreign companies, questioned the sponsors of the bill
as to the effect of the bill upon such practices. In the House
debates, Mr. Moore of Pennsylvania asked: "Suppose a combination
in which Americans join with foreigners had been
formed?" To this query Congressman Webb replied: "Then
you violate the antitrust law and it has been so held by the
court." Later, in the Senate debates, Senator Pomerene stated:
"There is nothing in this bill authorizing the division of territory
abroad."

Attempts to amend the Act between 1921 and 1928 failed.
Amendments proposed in 1928 would have extended the Act
to include combinations for importation of crude rubber, potash,
sisal and other raw materials not made, produced, or grown in
substantial quantities within the United States. The bill proposed
that year was stated by the House Judiciary Committee
to be designed "to meet an acute situation affecting the import
trade of the country" by reason of the fact that certain foreign
governments controlled and operated monopolies dealing in
rubber, potash and sisal for which this country depended materially
upon importations. Because of the operation of these foreign
monopolies the price to American importers had been
greatly increased. The Committee thought that the best way
of meeting "these alien government combinations" was to allow
American buyers of the monopolized products to combine for
the purpose of importing them. During debates on the bill it
was attacked, among other things, on the ground that if it were
passed, import associations would be permitted to join with
foreign producers in worldwide agreements arranging world
markets and fixing world prices. The bill failed to pass, Congress
thus indicating its unwillingness to extend further the application
of the Webb Act.

Thus it is clear that from the very beginning of the agitation
for the Act it was understood that the activities of export associations
would have to be strictly limited to the promotion of
foreign export trade, and that any agreements or activities
which restrain domestic competitors either in domestic or foreign
commerce would still be illegal under the Sherman Act.
This, it seems to me, is what has been overlooked by those who
now question the application of the Sherman Act to activities of
export associations which restrain domestic competition and the
export trade of competitors.

The Department of Justice is not seeking any novel interpretation
of the Sherman Act or of the Webb Act. We have thus
far instituted one suit involving associations formed under the
Webb Act and it requires no novel interpretation of the Act to
sustain the allegations involved.

In that suit, filed on March 16, 1944, we charged two American
export associations, 13 American manufacturers, and a British
corporation and its American agent, with maintaining international
cartel agreements to restrain trade in the manufacture
and marketing of <i>alkalis</i>, in violation of the Sherman Antitrust
Act. Our complaint asserted that the 17 defendants and four
co-conspirators--two American corporations, one German, and
one Belgian--had conspired to allocate and maintain exclusive
marketing areas and export quotas throughout the world, eliminating
competition and restraining exports in alkalis by means
of illegal contracts, agreements and understandings still in effect!

The following were named as defendants in the complaint:
United States Alkali Export Association, Inc. ("Alkasso"), a
Delaware corporation with principal offices in New York City;
California Alkali Export Association ("Calkex"), a California
corporation with principal offices in Los Angeles; Imperial
Chemical Industries Ltd. ("ICI"), a British corporation with
principal offices in London, England; Imperial Chemical Industries
(New York) Ltd., a New York corporation wholly owned
and controlled by ICI, London; Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company,
Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation with principal offices in
New York City; Church & Dwight Company, Inc., a Delaware
corporation with principal offices in New York City; Diamond
Alkali Company, Inc., a Delaware corporation with principal
offices in Pittsburgh, Pa.; Dow Chemical Company, Inc.,
a Michigan corporation with principal offices in Midland,
Mich.; Hooker Electrochemical Company, Inc., a New York
corporation with principal offices in Niagara Falls, N. Y.; The
Mathieson Alkali Works, Inc., a Virginia corporation with principal
offices in New York City; Niagara Alkali Company, a
New York corporation with principal offices in New York City;
Pennsylvania Salt Manufacturing Company, a Pennsylvania
corporation with principal offices in Philadelphia; Southern Alkali
Corporation, a Delaware corporation with principal offices
in New York City; Westvaco Chlorine Products Corporation,
a Delaware corporation with principal offices in New York City;
Wyandotte Chemicals Corporation, a Michigan corporation
with principal offices in Detroit; West End Chemical Company,
Inc., a California corporation with principal offices in
Oakland; and Pacific Alkali Company, Inc., a limited partnership
organized and registered in California with principal offices
in Los Angeles. Named as co-conspirators were: American Potash
& Chemical Corporation, a Delaware corporation with principal
offices in New York City, substantially all of whose capital
stock beneficially owned by the German potash trust, was seized
by the Alien Property Custodian in 1942; Solvay Process Company,
a New York corporation with principal offices in New
York City; Solvay et Cie. ("Belgian Solvay"), a Belgian corporation
with principal offices formerly in Brussels but now in
London, England; and I. G. Farbenindustrie Aktiengesellschaft,
a German corporation with headquarters in Frankfort-am-Main,
Germany.

This suit is of major importance in the drive to eliminate the
effect of cartels on American commerce. It is the first suit
which the Antitrust Division has filed involving the activities
of associations organized under the Webb Export Trade Act.
It should serve as a warning of our determination to prevent
cartel groups from carrying out their illegal plans by use of the
Webb Act.

"Alkalis," it should be explained, include soda ash (sodium
carbonate), caustic soda (sodium hydroxide) and bicarbonate
of soda. Soda ash is used in the manufacture of glass, textiles
and chemicals. Caustic soda is used in the manufacture of soap,
textiles, rayon and paper and in the refining of petroleum products.
Sodium bicarbonate is used for many industrial, chemical
and drug purposes and, purified, as baking soda. In 1939, there
were produced in the United States approximately 2,900,000
tons of soda ash, worth more than $50,000,000; approximately
1,000,000 tons of caustic soda, worth more than $40,000,000;
and approximately 140,000 tons of refined bicarbonate of soda,
worth more than $5,000,000.

All the domestic defendants in the suit, with the exception of
Alkasso, Calkex and ICI (N. Y.), were engaged in the manufacture
and sale of alkalis in the United States and conduct substantially
all of their export trade in alkalis through Alkasso
and Calkex. Alkasso was organized in 1919 and filed a verified
statement with the Federal Trade Commission to obtain benefits
and immunities provided by the Webb Export Trade Act.
Alkasso's members, who control and manage all its activities,
include defendants Pennsylvania Salt, Pittsburgh Plate Glass,
Hooker Electrochemical, Diamond, Mathieson, Westvaco,
Church & Dwight, Dow, Niagara and Southern. Alkasso obtains
alkalis from its members, transporting from warehouses
maintained at Hoboken, N. J., and New Orleans, La., to markets
throughout the world. Calkex was organized similarly in
1936 by American Potash & Chemical, West End Chemical and
Pacific Alkali, who control and manage its activities. It obtains
alkalis from member companies and ships from Pacific Coast
ports to various world markets. Prior to 1940, Alkasso and
Calkex together exported 95% of the alkalis exported from the
United States. Since then, because of war conditions and the
resignation of Solvay from Alkasso in 1941, the alkalis exported
by the two associations have amounted to 75% of the total alkali
exports from the U. S.

It is charged that beginning in 1924 and continuing to the
present day the defendants have engaged in an unlawful combination
and conspiracy in restraint of trade and commerce in
alkalis and that they have been and are parties to contracts,
agreements and understandings in violation of the Sherman
Act. This continuing agreement, it is alleged, provides:

(1) That Alkasso, Calkex, their respective members, ICI,
I. G. Farben, and Belgian Solvay not compete with each other
in the sale of alkalis in any market of the world outside of the
United States, and that ICI, I. G. Farben and Belgian Solvay
refrain from importing alkalis into the United States;

(2) That Alkasso, Calkex and their respective members be
assigned certain marketing areas as their exclusive territory (including
the U. S.) and that ICI, I. G. Farben and Belgian Solvay
refrain from exporting alkalis to such territory and prevent
other European manufacturers from doing so;

(3) That exclusive market areas be assigned to ICI (the
British Empire exclusive of Canada), I. G. Farben (Scandinavia),
and Belgian Solvay (Continental Europe exclusive of
the Scandinavian countries), and that Alkasso and Calkex and
their respective members refrain from exporting alkalis to such
territories and prevent other American manufacturers from
doing so.

(4) That the rest of the world markets be shared jointly by
Alkasso, Calkex, their respective members, and ICI, with competition
therein eliminated by allocating quotas to British and
American companies and limiting their exports to certain fixed
percentages of the total sold in such areas and by agreeing
among themselves on the prices at which alkalis are sold in such
markets;

(5) That Alkasso, Calkex and their respective members prevent
other American manufacturers and dealers from exporting
to joint territory except in compliance with quota and price
agreements fixed for such markets.

(6) That Alkasso, Calkex, and their respective members
conduct their export trade and utilize the aforesaid arrangements
and their practices thereunder in such manner as to enhance,
stabilize and maintain at uniform and non-competitive
levels the prices at which caustic soda is sold in the United
States.

It is alleged that the results of this conspiracy have been:

(1) To eliminate competition by Alkasso, Calkex and their
members with ICI and European producers of alkalis in the
manufacture and marketing of alkalis throughout the world;

(2) To eliminate exports of alkalis by ICI, Belgian Solvay
and I. G. Farben to the United States;

(3) To eliminate exports of alkalis by Alkasso, Calkex and
other American manufacturers to many markets of the world;
and to restrict and curtail by quota arrangements the export of
alkalis from the United States to many world markets;

(4) To eliminate competition by Alkasso and its members
with Calkex and its members in exports of alkalis from the
United States;

(5) To curtail and limit the production of alkalis within the
United States;

(6) To prevent competition between manufacturers of alkalis
in the United States (who are not members of Alkasso and Calkex)
and Alkasso, Calkex, ICI, Belgian Solvay and I. G. Farben
in world markets;

(7) To prevent independent exporters of alkalis in the
United States from engaging in the export of such commodities;
and

(8) To enhance, stabilize and maintain at arbitrary price
levels the prices at which caustic soda is sold in the United
States.

The Department of Justice sought the abrogation of the illegal
contracts and agreements and a permanent injunction against
the defendants restraining them from violating the Sherman
Act. The Government also asked that the defendants be enjoined
from entering into any future contract, agreement or
understanding with any foreign company in any manner restricting
their exports of alkalis from the United States by division
of export markets, allocation of territories, fixing of prices
in export sales, or fixing or observing any export quotas. The
Government further asked that the domestic defendants be enjoined
from selling alkalis exported from the United States in
any foreign markets through ICI (N. Y.) or through any agent
or dealer selling alkalis for or on behalf of ICI or ICI (N. Y.).

Thus, in this case, we allege a conspiracy to restrain the exports
of American competitors; to restrict imports to the United
States and thereby restrain trade within the United States; to
curtail and limit production in the United States, and to enhance,
stabilize and maintain price levels within the United
States. These allegations clearly charge a violation of the Sherman
Act. The Webb Act, I am confident, does not protect activities
of this type.

The allegations in this single instance against a Webb Export
Association raise serious questions of law violation which
cannot be ignored. The suggestion that we are stretching the
Sherman Act by novel interpretation simply does not stand up.
Associations organized under the Webb Act should take warning
that the Alkali case represents the view of the Department
of Justice as to the application of the Sherman Act to the activities
of such associations. The position of the Department is in
accord with the purpose, history and language of the Webb Act.

It is the policy of the Department of Justice to enforce the
Sherman Act as vigorously as possible whenever evidence establishes
probable violation. The Sherman Act represents a
Congressional policy of more than fifty years' standing. The
Department of Justice did not create the Act although it has the
responsibility of making it effective. The Department of Justice
does not interpret the Act. That is the task of the courts.
It is true, however, that the attitude of the Department of Justice
toward antitrust law enforcement is predicated, frankly, not
on a passive interest in the matter--a grudging willingness to
perform an unwelcome duty--but on a deep conviction that
Congress is right, and that the public economic policy embodied
in the Sherman Act is basically sound.

So long as the conditions which gave rise to the Webb Act
still exist, the Act, if properly employed, may be useful in promoting
trade within the special and limited domain to which the
Act applies. To meet centralized buying by centralized selling,
and to stand up against the exclusionary tactics and monopolistic
practices of well-established foreign cartels is sometimes necessary.
Joint action by American exporters may serve to secure an
equal footing in foreign trade in markets where combination is
permitted or even encouraged. No doubt such retaliatory measures
are wasteful as ways of organizing world trade, and no
doubt we and other nations would be better advised to join
hands in getting rid of international trade restraints, theirs and
our alike. Meanwhile, however, the Webb Act has a use in defending
American interests in markets which are too often cartelized.

If export associations are to be economically useful in the
postwar world, approved by public policy and serving the purpose
for which they were created, they must be the spearhead of
American industry as it enters into competition with foreign industry
for a fair share of world markets, rather than the tool of
international monopolists to draw American industries into restrictive
cartel agreements which contain provisions in conflict
with the Sherman Act.

I have given some thought to the question whether the
Webb Act should be tightened--whether additional legislation
should be enacted to assure that possible abuses shall be eradicated.
Some of those who have suggested such legislation apparently
feel that export associations, operating under the cloak
of the Webb Act, may be used to carry American industries into
private international cartels which operate contrary to our public
policy, and that serious consideration should be given now to
legislation that would make such abuses impossible.

But at present, I am not ready to believe that additional legislation
is necessary. Vigilant enforcement of the Sherman Act
against those who misuse the Webb Act together with the understanding
and cooperation of industry will make additional
legislation unnecessary and prove adequate to prevent export
associations from becoming screens for illegal cartel activity.
The appreciation by industry itself of the advantage of avoiding
restrictive agreements is an important factor in our future policy.
But if antitrust enforcement should prove ineffectual, and
if the postwar period should be characterized by widespread
misuse of export associations operating under the cloak of the
Webb Act, then, of course, serious consideration will have to be
given to legislation which will end the abuses.




13

<i>Private Governments</i>


One of the foremost problems facing our government today
is the formulation of an economic policy for the future. The
development of this policy is the concern of every American and
will affect vitally (1) the domestic prosperity of this country,
(2) our role in world affairs, (3) our national security. I should
like to point out in this connection certain important considerations
which must be taken into account if errors of the past are
to be avoided and progress in the future guaranteed.

No economic policy adopted by the government can be effective
if the industrial policies of the country in the international
field are determined, controlled, and executed by private agreements
of which the government has no knowledge. The formulation
and conduct of the foreign policy of the United States is
provided for in the Constitution: "[The President] shall have
Power, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to
make Treaties, provided two thirds of the Senators present
concur."

Past history demonstrates clearly that our economic foreign
policy has in many instances been rendered ineffectual by the
operation of secret agreements conceived and ratified by cartels.
These agreements admit of no sovereignty other than their own,
and serve no interests other than the shortsighted aims of monopoly.
This has only too often resulted in situations which
have endangered our national security, injured our position in
the world economy, and denied us opportunity for the fullest
use of our resources and labor. Domestically, businessmen have
had to yield to the dictates of large aggregates of power vested
in international cartels. What and how much they might produce,
and to whom and at what price they might sell, have been
decided for them. If they did not yield, they risked elimination.

Internationally, our foreign policy has in many respects been
frustrated. The Good Neighbor policy governing our relations
with Latin America, the reciprocal trade treaties, our alien property
policy, and other basic principles of America's conduct of
foreign affairs have in many instances been seriously weakened
by the interference of cartel activities. Indeed, it is difficult to
see how our future policies--for example the Atlantic Charter--can
be executed successfully, if the dispositions made by cartels
continue into the postwar world.

Cartels will find it difficult to operate if the agreements
upon which they are based are open to public scrutiny and examination.
Any law requiring the filing of international agreements
should operate like the Foreign Agents' Registration Act.
It should not give immunity to cartels, but should let the government
and the public know of their existence, their identity,
and their scope.

The cost of secrecy is illustrated by the following examples.
Two very basic raw materials necessary to any industrial community
are petroleum and rubber. The crucial nature of these
materials to our industrial economy and military operations is
clearly apparent. Without them, practically all industrial activity
would cease. Yet our oil and rubber supplies have been
dependent upon policies arrived at secretly, operated clandestinely,
and run in a manner contrary to the fundamental foreign
policy of our country. The public had no voice in making
these private policies, yet today it bears the burden of their
effects.

The very nature of modern warfare and industrial life is such
that both petroleum and rubber have political and military, as
well as economic, aspects. Not all countries have petroleum
within their borders and, prior to the present war, only Britain,
for practical purposes, had rubber. Access to these raw materials
is a prime military requisite to any nation desirous of maintaining
a strong international position. Without them, no nation
could hope to wage a war, maintain a healthy industrial economy,
or impose a treaty of Munich.

Among Germany's raw material deficiencies, oil and rubber
have been the two greatest. Within her own borders there is
little, if any, oil, and no rubber. This fact has certainly been a
consideration in the basis of our own as well as the French and
British foreign policy. Hence, the discovery in 1926 that petroleum
could be made from Germany's plentiful coal was a political
event of the first magnitude. That synthetic rubber became
a reality in Germany shortly afterward served to magnify the
shock.

The petroleum industry, dominated in this country by Standard
Oil Co. (New Jersey), was shaken at its very foundation.
A Standard Oil official, Frank Howard, wrote at the time from
Mannheim, Germany, on March 28, 1926, to Walter Teagle,
president of Standard Oil, the following:

"Based upon my observations and discussion today, I think
that this matter is the most important which has ever faced
the company since the dissolution.

"The Badische can make high grade motor fuel from lignite
and other low quality coals in amounts up to half the weight
of the coal. This means absolutely the independence of Europe
on the matter of gasoline supply. Straight price competition is
all that is left....

"They can make up to 100% by weight from any liquid
hydrocarbon, tar, fuel oil, or crude oil. This means that refining
of oil will have as a competitive industry in America and elsewhere,
catalytic conversion of the crude into motor fuel.

<tb>

"I shall not attempt to cover any details, but I think this
will be evidence of my state of mind."

Standard Oil was worried about its monopoly position. The
discovery threatened competition and Standard Oil met the
threat.

The process of making oil from coal was controlled by I. G.
Farbenindustrie, the German chemical trust. In 1926 a meeting
between Standard Oil and I. G. Farben was arranged. The
result was a series of treaties. The agreements preserved the
position of the parties in the fields which they respectively dominated.
As stated by a Standard Oil official: "The I. G. are
going to stay out of the oil business proposition and we are going
to stay out of the chemical business insofar as that has no bearing
on the oil business."

Competition between I. G. Farben and Standard Oil was
eliminated, and the technology of chemistry and petroleum was
was made part of their feudal preserve. The economic effect
was the maintenance of monopoly.

Stated in a more detailed way, Standard Oil was given the
world right on the oil process and I. G. Farben was given the
chemical business of the world. But there was one exception.
While I. G. was given the right to engage in the oil business in
Germany, Standard Oil was permitted to engage in the chemical
business in the United States only as a junior partner to I. G.
The staggering implications of this are clear. Germany could
not afford, considering her aims, to permit any outsider to control
within her own borders as important a development to her
national life as the production of oil from coal.

But when Standard Oil gave up its rights in the chemical
field, including those in the United States, the repercussions
were to seriously affect our wartime efforts.

Included in the chemical field was the synthetic rubber, buna.
Under the agreements, therefore, it was a German-controlled
monopoly. When the war broke out in September 1939, the
Germans had not permitted buna to be manufactured in the
United States. We had no experience, information, or know-*how,
and we had not obtained permission from Germany to
produce synthetic rubber. Of equal importance is the fact that
the United States Government had no knowledge of these facts.
The terms of the Standard Oil-I. G. Farben treaty were secret.

When corporations outside the I. G.-Standard Oil orbit attempted
to manufacture buna rubber, they were confronted with
the combined strength, wealth and power of the private coalition.
Goodrich and Goodyear attempted such production, but
the former was sued for patent infringement and the latter formally
threatened with suit by the Standard Oil Company under
the I. G. patents. This took place in October 1941, a few weeks
before Pearl Harbor. Thus, not only did Standard Oil agree
with I. G. Farben that the latter should control the exploitation
of synthetic rubber, but cooperated in preventing anyone
else from producing. In fact, on April 20, 1938, a Standard Oil
official wrote as follows:

"Until we have this permission, however, there is absolutely
nothing we can do and we must be especially careful not to
make any move whatever even on a purely informal, personal
or friendly basis, without the consent of our friends. We know
some of the difficulties they have, both from business complications
and interrelations with the rubber and chemical trades in
the United States, and from a national standpoint in Germany,
but we do not know the whole situation--and since under the
agreement they have full control over the exploitation of this
process, the only thing we can do is to continue to press for authority
to act, but in the meantime loyally preserve the restrictions
they have put on us."

On its own, Standard Oil received little, if any, information
on synthetic rubber from I. G. The following quotations from
Standard Oil letters and documents are clear:

"Our people have never made buna ... the I. G. has not
furnished anyone technical information."

"The only information our people have is derived from published
patents."

"Information ... about the technical aspects of this development
has not been forthcoming as a result of the German Government's
refusal because of military expediency to permit I. G.
to reveal such information to anyone outside Germany."

The ambiguous position in which Standard found itself arises
from the fact that Standard never considered that it was making
foreign policy, or took into account the political implications of
its acts. We neither expect nor require this of our businessmen.
After all, they are not supposed to have such responsibility.
Nevertheless, neither Standard Oil nor the country could escape
the consequences of these agreements. It would seem, in the
light of this experience, that the least the Government can do is
to provide a mechanism for acquainting itself with the existence
and terms of such agreements. The Government, on the other
hand, is unable to make proper judgments if it does not have
complete information.

The Monroe Doctrine and the Good Neighbor policy are
both pillars of our foreign relations. Nevertheless, many cartel
agreements ran directly counter to these policies. The causes
of conflict are not difficult to understand. In a large number of
cartel agreements, world territory is divided into exclusive, non-*competitive
domains. In the drug, magnesium, optical glass,
dyestuffs, plastics and a host of fields, the United States was the
exclusive territory of American cartel members. The rest of the
world was allocated to Germany. This included Latin America.
As a result, the Germans were able to set up economic colonies
in Latin America and elsewhere free from American competition.
The large members of Nazis in South America were a
partial consequence of the character of these agreements.

When the Nazis came to power in Germany, they immediately
utilized the cartel system as a device for political, as well
as economic, infiltration in countries outside of Germany, particularly
in the Western Hemisphere. A bold assertion of this
policy is set forth in a communication, written in 1933, from a
director of Robert Bosch, A. G., of Germany, to the president
of the United American Bosch Corporation, which states:

"With regard to the political situation ... only one thing is
very evident, namely, that all forces of administrative and economic
endeavour such as the different cartels, etc., are to be
brought into one definite line of endeavour coinciding, of course,
with the policy of the ruling [Nazi] party and that individual
opinions and utterances will be submitted to a similar rule."

When the present war broke out, Germany, because of the sea
blockade, was unable to supply goods to Latin America. Cartels
made full provision for the contingency of war. The South
American market was preserved for the German firms by cartel
members of other countries, notably the United States. Not
only did American cartel members supply products to the German
agents in South America, in many cases they used German
labels. What is most important, they agreed to withdraw at the
end of the war and once again give Germany a free hand in
Latin America. In some cases, realizing that the blacklist
might make this kind of arrangement difficult, dummy firms
in South America stood ready to replace those blacklisted.
Many instances of efforts by cartels to maintain their usual relations,
and to preserve the restrictions by which German dominance
in South American markets was achieved, are available.
A characteristic attitude is indicated in the statement made by
the head of the Chemical Marketing Co., an American firm,
which had relations with the Deutsche Gold-und-Silber Scheideanstalt
of Germany. In the early period of the war, this
officer of the American company wrote:

"We insure thereby that the German trade up to the present
with our South and Central American friends can be held firmly
in our hands and, should export from Germany become impossible--as
you yourself can well visualize--the loss would be
much less if for the duration of the war American chemicals
can be delivered, rather than complete loss of business for many,
many years, if we place our clients in such a position that they
can continue to serve their customers."

The dyestuffs industry ranks among the most strategic
branches of production. During the first World War, the United
States and the Allies experienced severe and crippling shortages
of dyestuffs, medicines and related products which were
controlled by the German dyestuffs cartel. In the years between
the Armistice in 1919 and the outbreak of the present
war in 1939, the United States endeavored to build up a strong
dyestuffs industry because of its peacetime as well as its wartime
importance. The German dye trust, however, succeeded
in re-establishing a substantial and significant degree of control
in this industry through a series of cartel agreements. In addition,
I. G. Farben, through its American subsidiary, General
Aniline & Film, was able to exert direct influence on the dyestuffs
market in the United States. In the many agreements
made between American, British and German dyestuffs producers,
the American companies were generally restricted to the
domestic markets.

Upon the outbreak of war, when the British blockade threatened
to cut off the exports of I. G., it nevertheless attempted to
insure the maintenance of its control over various markets. The
boldness of I. G.'s tactics is indicated in a cable addressed to
General Aniline & Film on September 19, 1939, which released
that firm from export restrictions for the purpose of supplying
I. G.'s customers and agents in the British Empire. This communication
stated:

"In addition to Canada we release you from export restriction
in regard to the following countries: Great Britain, British India,
Australia, New Zealand but only for duration of present
state of war and as far as supplies to following firms are concerned."
[A list of distributing agents within the British Empire
is included.]

This cable was modified on September 21, 1939, when I. G.
communicated further with General Aniline & Film, stating:
"Replace in first telegram 'for duration of present state of war'
by 'until further notice' and act accordingly." Similar arrangements
were made regarding I. G.'s distributing agencies in
South America. This effort on I. G.'s part to circumvent the
British blockade is further illustration of the implications which
inhere in such cartel arrangements.

The same type of practice was no less significant in other
parts of the world. In the winter of 1941, while Congress was
debating the Lend-Lease Act, cartel agreements had already decreed
that certain critical types of products could not be sold to
Great Britain. For example, when Great Britain attempted to
place an order for tetrazene-primed ammunition, a cartel agreement
between du Pont and I. G. Farben forbade their sale, and
it was not made.

In this case the patent attorney for the Remington Arms
Company, a subsidiary of du Pont, wrote a memorandum dated
January 23, 1941, stating:

"The further sale of Tetrazene Primed Ammunition to the
British Purchasing Commission or to the Government of the
Union of South Africa or to the Government of Canada is most
undesirable by reason of our Tetrazene contract with R. W. S.
[Rheinische Westfalische Sprengstoff, a wholly-owned subsidiary
of I. G. Farben].

"Article III, Paragraph D of the original contract of November
14, 1929, reads as follows: 'Remington shall not sell
military ammunition containing any Tetrazene in Germany and
in any or all of the countries in the British Empire.'

<tb>

"There can be little if any question that pistol and revolver
ammunition sold at this time to his Majesty's Government in
the United Kingdom is military ammunition ... or that such
sale is a sale in a country of the British Empire within the intent
of Article III D of the contract.

"We understand that the Process Division have recommended
the use of Tetrazene priming in certain ammunition to be
sold to the British Purchasing Commission. It appears obvious
that this should not be done."

Similar situations existed in aviation precision equipment,
drugs, and chemicals. Thus, I. G. Farben sought to obtain assurances
from du Pont that information on certain industrial
processes would not be transmitted to the British. On October
4, 1939, 1. G. wrote to du Pont, stating:

"You advise us that for the duration of the war, you will not
pass the experiences and applications which you receive from
one licensee on to another. We thank you for having quickly
taken the necessary steps for meeting the altered conditions."

A significant and clear-cut example of the way in which cartel
agreements enabled the German Government to influence the
policies of American cartel partners of German industry is provided
in the case of aviation instruments. In this instance Siemens-Halske,
the great German electrical equipment producer,
wrote to Bendix Aviation Company on October 25, 1939, as
follows:

"Under our agreement your geographical contract territory
includes the United States, its territories and Canada. A state
of war exists at the present time between Canada and ourselves.

"Notwithstanding the war we are of course willing to live up
to the agreement as far as possible. However, we would appreciate
receiving your assurance that the records which you will
receive from us within the scope of our agreement will not be
given to Canada for the duration of the war and that you will
supply no instruments, built under a license, if you know that
they are destined for our enemies."

An official of Bendix answered:

"As regards the drawings sent over you may rest assured.
As regards fabrication ... we will arrange to the best of our
ability to keep within the orbit of domestic use."

One of the most necessary economic measures of war is the
seizure of enemy property. Although we have a policy concerning
enemy property, the Antitrust Division of the Department
of Justice has come across frequent attempts to nullify this
policy by private agreement.

In one case, I. G. Farben transferred over 2,000 patents to
the Standard Oil Company. While there may be some dispute
as to the purpose of the assignment, the fact is clear. The Alien
Property Custodian, even though he has vested this property,
found himself in litigation as to whether the patents were in fact
transferred in a bona fide manner. Taken together with the provision
in the Standard Oil-I. G. Farben contract, this instance
presents the result of a carefully-conceived and well-developed
policy of not only considering the war as an unfortunate interlude,
but as a method of defeating public policy. The clause
in question provides that even if the agreement should be interfered
with by the government of the United States or if, in
effect, war should take place between the countries of the respective
parties, then at the conclusion of such interruption the
parties shall come to a new agreement "in the spirit of the old."

Another phase of the relationships between Standard Oil and
I. G. Farben with respect to the eventuality of war between
the United States and Germany is indicated in a letter written
by the Assistant Comptroller of Standard Oil to one of the
directors of the company, on September 8, 1939. The body of
this letter deals with the Standard-I. G. Corporation, a joint
subsidiary in which Standard Oil owned 80% and I. G. 20%,
which had been formed to carry out the purposes of the Standard
Oil-I. G. agreements. Standard Oil was considering the
purchase of I. G.'s holdings in this subsidiary company. One
paragraph in the letter indicates clearly the objective which
Standard Oil sought. This paragraph states:

"Of course what we have in mind is protecting this minority
interest in the event of war between ourselves and Germany as
it would certainly be very undesirable to have this 20% interest
in Standard-I. G. passed to an Alien Property Custodian who
might sell to an unfriendly interest."

Another case shows how devious and complex cartel schemes
can be. Briefly, the Siemens-Halske Company of Germany and
the Beryllium Corporation of America entered into an agreement
concerning the production and distribution of beryllium
alloys which had all the usual characteristics of a cartel, such
as the division of world territory, etc.

Before this highly interesting agreement was entered into,
however, Siemens-Halske attempted to protect its position by
assigning its patents in this field to the Metal & Thermit Company
of New York. Actually these patents were held by Metal
& Thermit in escrow for the Siemens-Halske Company. For
this service, the Metal & Thermit Company received $10,000.

Without such a bill as is now contemplated, no Alien
Property Custodian could have known that the above patents
were really property of an enemy national. They would have
remained concealed in this instance if it had not been for the
fortuitous action of an investigation by the Department of Justice.

The titanium and optical goods cases previously related are
other examples of this practice.

The development of the magnesium industry in the United
States provides further illustration of the political effects of
cartels in addition to the corrosive effects of monopoly upon
industrial expansion. From an international standpoint the cartelization
of the magnesium industry prior to the outbreak of
the present war had equally serious effects. As a consequence of
both monopoly and international cartel arrangements in the industry,
Germany obtained an initial lead in the production of
magnesium while at the same time Germany's potential opponents
were restricting magnesium output. According to estimates
made by the U. S. Bureau of Mines, Germany produced
61% of the world's total output of magnesium in 1937. The
United States produced 10%. In 1940 Germany was still producing
one-half of the world's output while the United States
was producing about 14%.

The importance of magnesium is indicated by the uses for
which it is employed. In general, its principal consumer is the
aircraft industry. Magnesium is used in the construction of
aircraft engines, the frames of airplanes, various interior parts,
wheels, and other similar portions of aircraft. Magnesium is
also employed in the manufacture of incendiary bombs, tracer
bullets, and flares.

The two principal producers in this country during the years
1919 to 1927 were the Dow Chemical Company and the American
Magnesium Company, a subsidiary of the Aluminum Company
of America. In 1927, the American Magnesium Company
ceased production, and the Dow Chemical Company thereafter
enjoyed a monopoly in the production of magnesium in the
United States. The American Magnesium Company by agreement
purchased all of its requirements from Dow and constituted
Dow's largest customer. In tracing the relationship between
Dow, the sole producer of magnesium, and Alcoa, the
sole producer of aluminum, during the period in question, it is
essential to bear in mind that magnesium is the principal technological
rival to aluminum. Nearly all of the functions for
which aluminum is employed can also be fulfilled by magnesium
with greater efficiency, in many instances, because magnesium is
not only one-third lighter than aluminum, but is more readily
machined and, when properly alloyed, has greater tensile
strength.

In the year 1931, I. G. Farbenindustrie, the principal producer
of magnesium in Germany, entered into an agreement
with the Aluminum Company of America known as the Alig
Agreement. According to the terms of this contract, a joint
corporation, the Magnesium Development Company, was
formed in which Alcoa and I. G. each held 50% control. The
Magnesium Development Company was primarily a patent-*holding
corporation to which I. G. transferred some patents
for the fabrication of magnesium and to which Alcoa contributed
process patents. In addition to participating in the Magnesium
Development Company, I. G. also obtained a 50% interest in
Alcoa's own subsidiary, the American Magnesium Company.

The significance of the arrangements between Alcoa and I. G.
was twofold: Alcoa was interested in obtaining a secure foothold
in the magnesium industry in order to protect its primary interest
in aluminum; I. G. was endeavoring by its usual tactics
to extend the sphere of its influence. It is especially significant
to note that in the Alig Agreement it was stipulated that any
licenses issued by the jointly-owned Magnesium Development
Company were to be restricted to the United States. It was
also provided that:

"As long as magnesium is produced by any ... producing
company under a license or licenses granted ... the holders
of the I. G. shares in Alig ... shall have the right to limit
the increases in production capacity of every such producing
company after the initial contemplated production capacity shall
have been reached. The initial contemplated production capacity
shall in no case be more than 4,000 tons per annum."

Dow Chemical Company was not a party to the 1931 agreement
between Alcoa and I. G. During the period immediately
following the Alig Agreement, every effort was made to bring
Dow into the cartel picture, with the consequence that, on January
1, 1934, Dow entered into a patent-holding agreement with
Magnesium Development Company. In 1933 also Dow and
American Magnesium Company had entered into a five-year
purchase contract by which the American Magnesium Company
was guaranteed a position as a preferred customer of Dow. In
return, Dow's position as the sole producer of magnesium was
protected.

In 1934 also Dow entered into a sales contract with I. G.
Farben. This contract stated:

"Dow agrees to confine its sales in Europe solely to the I. G.,
with the exception that it reserves the right to sell the British
Maxium or its successors not more than 300,000 pounds (150
tons) per annum at a price not lower than the price quoted to
I. G. for the same quantities, plus an extra charge of not less
than 4c per pound for I. G.'s larger consumption. Dow further
promises to use its best endeavor to keep British Maxium or its
successors from reselling magnesium in ingot form and will try
to limit its purchases to its own use in fabricating."

During 1934 and 1935 Dow delivered to I. G. (which was,
of course, the principal producer of magnesium in the world)
more than 3,800,000 pounds of magnesium out of Dow's total
production of little more than 4,000,000 pounds. This magnesium
was sold to I. G. at a price approximately 30% below
the price to Dow's other customers, with the exception of American
Magnesium Corporation, which also enjoyed a preferential
position. It is interesting to note that, during this same period,
the sales manager of Dow Chemical travelled to England and
wrote to his home office as follows:

"They [British Maxium] are very much in need of additional
magnesium for the balance of 1935, but they understand
our position perfectly well and do not blame us at all because
we are not in a position to furnish them the metal they want.
They were at fault in not getting in touch with us sooner regarding
their increased demands. They advised me that they
had exported 20 tons of ingot to Europe but I later obtained
definite proof from Mr. Ziegler of the I. G. that they had exported
60 tons in Europe. If they had kept this metal in England
they would have had sufficient supplies for this year."

It may be remarked that, in consequence of these arrangements
between Dow and I. G., I. G.'s position in the European
magnesium market was enormously strengthened. One particularly
significant result of I. G.'s dominance was that Great
Britain was rendered primarily dependent upon Germany for
its magnesium imports. As late as 1938, 87.9% of the magnesium
imported into Great Britain was obtained from Germany.
When war broke out, Great Britain was at once cut off
from a large part of its magnesium supply.

From the standpoint of the development of the industry in
the United States, it is clear that the total effect of the arrangements
among Alcoa, I. G., and Dow was to restrict magnesium
production. The extent of the disparity in the magnesium output
of Germany and the United States is clearly evident in the
production figures for the years 1937 to 1940. In 1940, the
year in which France fell, the United States produced 5,680
tons, while Germany produced more than 19,000 tons. Strenuous
efforts on the part of the government and industry have
been necessary to expand magnesium production sufficiently to
meet our minimum wartime needs. The large plant construction
undertaken by the government in cooperation with various
magnesium producers has achieved initial success. It is clearly
evident, however, that the magnesium program had to be inaugurated
and carried out under the tremendous handicap of
the monopoly situation which existed in the industry prior to
the war.

It is equally clear that, from a political standpoint, the government
began its operations completely in the dark. It is
scarcely credible that, had the arrangements between Alcoa and
I. G. and between Dow and I. G. been known to the government
at the time at which they were made, the risks inherent
in the private treating making of this type would have been permitted
to stand.

It is characteristic of many cartel agreements which are
arrived at secretly and maintained in silence that concealment of
their provisions is motivated by the desire to avoid scrutiny of
their operations by public authority. In some instances, the
illegal nature of the terms of cartel agreements explains the
cloak of secrecy which is cast over their provisions. Moreover,
it is often stipulated in cartel agreements that, in any eventuality
of action taken by government, the parties to the agreements
shall cooperate in order to maintain their relationships despite
anything that government may do.

There are numerous examples among the many agreements
which have been investigated by the Department of Justice
which clearly reveal the intent as well as the necessity for secrecy
from the point of view of the cartels. Thus, in a letter from
Canadian Industries, Limited, to the du Pont Company, the
writer states:

"In the course of recent meetings in connection with the new
Patents and Processes Agreement, I understand a suggestion
has been made by the du Pont legal representatives which will
involve the new agreement making specific reference to the
respective territorial rights of du Pont and ICI. I cannot help
feeling that on broad grounds this is undesirable both from the
viewpoint of C-I-L and of the major stockholders. For instance,
should any investigation take place in Canada which will require
the production of this agreement, the clause in question would
automatically necessitate the production in its term of the ICI
and du Pont agreements: at least that is the way we would read
it, and this would be bound to lead to publicity of a very undesirable
nature in regard to the division of world territories.
My practical suggestion is that, as the detailed prior commitments
are now to be dealt with in the form of a letter separate
from the agreement (this at the suggestion of the du Pont legal
representatives) it might be possible to include the point in
question in that separate letter also."

The attitude of cartels toward the relation between their own
policies and the policies of government are epitomized in the
exchange of correspondence between Sir Harry McGowan,
Chairman of the Board of Imperial Chemical Industries, and
Lammot du Pont in May 1933. Sir Harry wrote:

"With a large organization such as we have I find it is a
good thing to issue such warnings from time to time--one went
out at the time of the Ottawa Conference--so that everything
possible is done to ensure that no prospective political or legislative
action on the part of governments is permitted to influence
relations between du Pont and I.C.I."

On June 17, 1933, Lammot du Pont replied as follows:

"I am much interested in what you say and have heartily
approved your attitude toward our Patents and Processes Agreement
and the relations between the two companies. I feel the
same; namely that our relations have been so happy and have
produced such satisfactory results that we should let nothing in
the way of international agreements interfere in any way with
the progress we have made or may make in the future. If any
legislation or international agreements are brought about which
affect these I.C.I.-du Pont relations I am sure we will be able
to adjust ourselves so as to get the continued benefit of our
agreement."

A striking and instructive illustration of the role of secrecy
in cartel agreements is provided in the terms of an arrangement
concerning the pharmaceutical industry, between the Schering
Corporation of Bloomfield, New Jersey, and the Schering, A.
G., of Germany. One clause in this agreement, which was made
in 1938, stated that "the existence, the content, and the details
of operation of this agreement have to be kept secret by both
parties notwithstanding the possible obligation of disclosing it
to public officials."

In connection with an agreement concerning the plastics industry,
the consideration taken into account by the Rohm &
Haas Company and du Pont are indicated in a memorandum
written by the latter company in 1936, in which it is stated:

"We discussed the whole situation again. They repeated over
and over again that there is not the slightest possibility of the
I.C.I.'s coming into the American market, but du Ponts are
afraid to write a letter to this effect because in the case of an
investigation of their firm by politicians, the politicians might
make capital of such a statement, i.e., they might attempt to
point out that the world was divided up between I.C.I. and
du Ponts.

"I told Mr. Wardenburg that I had implicit faith in all the
assurances which they had made to me, but that for my own
protection I had to have a letter from du Ponts, in which they
can assure us, in one way or another, that the I.C.I. will not
take the opportunity to come into this market. After a lengthy
discussion of the different ways to accomplish this purpose, it
was agreed that Mr. Wardenburg will write a letter saying that
while it is true that the I.C.I. under their contract have a right
to come into the American market, they [du Ponts] happen to
know that the I.C.I.'s development in the methacrylic ester
field has taken a direction which is quite different from the one
that is being taken by du Ponts and ourselves, so that it will be
highly improbable that the I.C.I. will attempt to come into the
U. S. market. I told him that such a letter will be satisfactory."

It is clear that cartel interests fear that the revelation of the
provisions of their agreements might impede the functioning of
the agreements or perhaps draw down upon them action by
public authority. Very often cartel agreements endeavor to
discount this possibility in advance. In the case of the agreements
between Standard Oil and I. G. Farbenindustrie it is
provided that:

"It is our understanding ... that each party proposes to hold
itself willing to take care of any future eventualities in a spirit
of mutual helpfulness particularly along the following lines:
In the event the performance of these agreements ... by either
party should be hereafter restrained or prevented by operation
of any existing or future law, or the beneficial interests of either
party be alienated to substantial degree by operation of law or
governmental authority, both parties should enter into new
negotiations in the spirit of the present agreements and endeavor
to adapt their relations to the changed conditions which
have arisen."

Because most cartel agreements provide for their resumption
at the end of the present war, efforts to rehabilitate world trade
may be insuperably handicapped unless prompt and effective
action is taken by the government with full knowledge of the
existence and character of such cartel agreements. Regardless
of the particular form or direction of this nation's trade policies
after the war they could not become effective if secret agreements
among the large industrial groups of the world contain
arrangements which clash with the government's program.

It is well to recall that the provisions of the Versailles Treaty
at the end of the first World War which prohibited the manufacture
of certain strategic products in Germany were rendered
ineffective in many instances. Through foreign subsidiaries and
under the cloak of cartel agreements with concerns in the United
States and other countries, German producers of military equipment
were able to nullify the application of the conditions imposed
by the Treaty.

Public authority must not be left in the position of having
to work in ignorance. Only by compelling the official acknowledgement
and registration of the existence and provisions of
agreements which affect our foreign and domestic commerce can
government acquaint itself with the arrangements which have
been made and which affect so vitally national security and national
welfare.

During the present war one of the most serious problems
with which the fighting services have had to contend on the
battle fronts is the frequency of malaria, one of the most widespread
diseases in the world. There are two standard remedies
for malaria: one is quinine, a natural product obtained from the
cinchona trees of Java; the other is atabrine, a synthetic coal-tar
product. Because the production and distribution of quinine
were controlled by one of the most closely-knit cartels in existence,
a shortage developed almost immediately when the
Japanese seized Java. The dwindling stockpile of quinine in
the United States compelled the government to call upon druggists
and housewives alike to turn over whatever small quantities
were on hand in order to keep the fighting front supplied.

In the case of atabrine, only one company in the United States
had a license to manufacture the drug under the I. G. Farben
patents. It required the concerted effort of manufacturers and
government to institute expanded production in order to
make up for the deficiencies of quinine. Fortunately, these efforts
have met with some success. With regard to the future,
however, it must be borne in mind that cartels which are able
to control and restrict the output of medical products, in particular
those which are so widely needed, as quinine and atabrine,
exert a direct influence on the military position of the United
States and other countries, as well as upon the general health
of the population. The opportunities for abuse which are present
in monopolistic control of medical products are obvious. It
is equally obvious that this government cannot afford to tolerate
them. It would seem a minimum precaution to require that
where cartels control the supply, the price, and the distribution
of medical products, they should be compelled to record the
terms on which control is based, in order that government might
in its turn develop adequate safeguards for the general welfare.

I believe it has been clearly demonstrated that certain fundamental
decisions affecting our relations with the rest of the
world have been formulated and put into effect by private
groups without the sanction or knowledge of government. These
decisions concerning our strategic materials, industries and trade,
our Good Neighbor and our European policies, our disposition
of enemy property, considerations of espionage, secrecy and the
evasion of our laws, have all been accomplished without the
knowledge of our government or its acquiescence.

If cartels are permitted to continue to enter into their secret
agreements, then it will be impossible for the peoples of the
world to develop mutual understanding or to share industrial
experience and progress. Cartels have been a focus of conspiracy
and distrust among nations in the past. It is not too much to
say that they will form a nucleus of future distrust and intrigue.
A world partitioned by cartels breeds economic friction and disunity.
We must face the fact that a cartelized postwar world
would inevitably be a world of suspicion and of clandestine international
intrigue. Full reciprocity in respect of trade and
technology can only be founded on mutual confidence and good
faith.

There is current a school of thought which believes we must
differentiate between good cartels and bad cartels. Do these
people still propose to leave the conduct of our foreign economic
policy in the hands of private monopolists, with the one
caveat that these people be good monopolists and not bad monopolists?
With all the best intentions in the world, it is neither
the role nor the responsibility of businessmen to determine political
questions which can only be resolved by constituted government.
This is a responsibility which I believe businessmen
should not undertake, and one which I believe that they do not
wish to undertake. Even those businessmen who have engaged
in these practices would be shocked to realize the implications
of their acts. At the time they were operating in this manner
they never thought in political terms, but rather in terms of
the local market. Once operating in the international market,
however, these businessmen found themselves in ambiguous
positions where they were forced to make choices which they
never contemplated. What would they do when confronted
with the problem of choosing between national policy as it
should be and their own private interests? It would seem, from
the standpoint of public interest, that when questions of national
concern arise they should be handled by properly constituted
government authority.

American businessmen have not realized the significance of
the relationship between their foreign cartel partners and the
foreign governments involved. I doubt that they knew, for
example, that the following statement was made by Mr. Meinhardt
of Osram, a member of the international lamp cartel: "An
international cartel has no right of existence and a German businessman
has no right to become a member of such a cartel if
this cartel is acting against the common interests of Germany."

The attitude of American businessmen is typified in the following
statement by an executive of the General Motors Company:
"an international business operating throughout the
world, should conduct its operations in strictly business terms,
without regard to the political beliefs of its management, or
the political beliefs of the country in which it is operating."

All American businessmen and the Congress particularly
should weigh with care the type of thinking which results from
a cartelized economy such as Germany's. Carl Duisberg, formerly
chairman of the board of I. G. Farbenindustrie, expressed
succinctly the philosophy of Germany's cartel system when he
said, in 1932: "The narrowness of the national economic territory
must be overcome by trans-national economic territories....
For a final settlement of the problem of Europe ... a
close economic combine must be formed from Bordeaux to
Odessa as the backbone of Europe." The ultimate consequences
of such cartel aims have been reckoned across the council tables
of Munich and the battlefields of Europe and Asia.

<i>Freedom or Control?</i>


All of us want our country to be strong and prosperous after
this war is won. In attaining strength and prosperity, foreign
trade will play an important part. Manufactured goods will
leave the shores of this country and will find their way through
the miracle of new forms of transportation, as well as on the
tramp steamer, to the four corners of the world. Raw materials,
and finished products as well, will come from these same four
corners into the hands of the American consumer. The foreign
trade of this country will be measured in billions of dollars.
And our nation will take its place and play its part in what
we believe can be a healthy world economy.

I do not think that there is any basic difference of opinion in
this country as to the importance of our foreign trade. There
appears to be some difference of views, however, as to how our
foreign trade shall be conducted in the post-war world. It is
argued that since Europe has a cartel system, if we wish to
carry on trade on commerce with Europe or in the world, we
must permit our foreign businesses to become cartelized. We
are told, in short, that we must join hands with the cartels if
we are to engage in foreign trade. Most of the people who
make this argument do so regretfully. They know that the
Sherman Antitrust Act, which prohibits restraints on both domestic
and foreign trade or commerce, has reflected the free
enterprise spirit of this country for more than fifty years. They
know that the people of this country are unalterably opposed to
a cartel system under which either the government or one's
competitors can determine what may be manufactured, how
much can be made, and what price may be charged. They know
that you cannot have a democratic system if enterprise is to be
subjected either to government bureaucracy or to the rule of
private trade councils. Nevertheless, these people, seeing a cartelized
world around us, believe that much as we may dislike
it, we cannot conduct foreign trade unless we join hands with
the cartels.

There is a small minority in this country, of course, which
has always opposed our own free enterprise system. If these
people could manage it, they would have the economy of this
country run by enlightened and benevolent monopolists. These
people make the argument, not at all regretfully, that we must
join hands with foreign cartels. They know that once we have
joined hands with foreign cartels, we will have opened the door
to monopoly at home, and that is what they want.

Let me venture a prediction. This country will engage in
foreign trade and commerce on a scale never before imagined,
and we are not going to join hands with any foreign cartels.
There will be a drive to get us into the foreign cartels; that
drive in fact is now going on. It will fail. It will fail for two
good reasons. The first of these is that our foreign trade would
not be helped in the least if we joined with the cartels. The second
and even more important reason is that this country is in
no mood to give up an American way of life because Europe
believes in cartels.

We have been willing to subject ourselves to all kinds of
governmental controls over American business in order to win
this war. When the war is over, these controls must go, and as
soon as possible. We are not going to keep these controls either
in the hands of the government or in the hands of a few private
individuals. We are not going to imitate the very foreign economic
system which we have defeated.

The monopolist tells us that European industry is cartelized
and that it will remain so after this war is over. What kind of
wishful thinking makes the monopolist so sure of that? I do
not believe that the French or the Belgians will wish to embrace
an economic system after this war is over which took their basic
industries and put them into the hands of an international set
of cartelists dominated by the Germans. I do not believe that
the British will wish to encourage a system which in March
1939 gave birth to the announcement between the Federation
of British Industries and the German Reichsgruppe Industrie
that the two groups would eliminate competition between British
and German industries, would fix prices, and would seek
the aid of their governments against the industry of any third
country, clearly meaning the United States, which did not join
in this limitation of production plan. Great Britain needed its
own full production in those days, and American production
as well. I do not believe, for that matter, that the British will
wish to have an economic system which has made the British
consumer pay high prices and has restricted production in both
Great Britain and the Dominions.

It is clear, of course, that in each country of the world, there
are a few monopolists who will benefit from the cartel system.
We have them in our country also. But we are not going to
let these few determine our own economic life, and we should
not let them control our attitude or actions in Europe. Certainly
it is too early to predict that Europe will remain cartelized after
this war. I think it is not unlikely that the consumers of Europe
will decide they have had enough of that system and will demand
a change.

But no matter what Europe does, our foreign trade will not
be helped in the least by our joining foreign cartels. The very
reverse is true. The way to kill American foreign trade is to
have American producers enter into international cartels. One
reason for the current drive to get American firms into foreign
cartels is precisely that. There are a few monopolists who do
not look with favor upon sales by American firms in the rest of
the world. They are terrified that our mass production methods
may benefit consumers in the rest of the world. They will not
be able to maintain their own prices if this should occur. Their
invitation for us to join them in cartel agreements is not an
invitation to engage in trade or commerce; it is an invitation
to discover upon what terms and conditions we will keep our
trade at home.

The record is very clear. A small number of powerful
American firms entered into illegal cartel agreements before
the war, particularly in the halcyon days of the twenties. These
were agreements to restrict American exports. Typically, the
American firms agreed not only not to export themselves but
wherever possible to keep other American firms from exporting.
These agreements occurred in synthetic nitrogen, aluminum,
magnesium, optical glass, electric lamps, pharmaceuticals,
plastics, chemicals and a host of other items. It is quixotic to
think of these agreements as having promoted foreign trade;
their whole purpose was to prevent it. Where was our foreign
trade when these firms agreed to turn over the Latin American
market in pharmaceuticals to the Germans? What foreign trade
was being promoted when we agreed not to export to Great
Britain more than a limited quantity of magnesium? The underlying
philosophy of these agreements was that if the foreign
firms would stay out of the American market, we would stay
out of the foreign market.

There is no mystery about this. The monopolists know it
very well as do the other American companies, large and small,
who were not permitted to export because if they did so, they
would interfere with the arrangements to keep trade and commerce
from flowing in either direction across the borders of this
country. The reasoning is clearly set forth by an official of an
American company in explaining why his company cannot
export:

"... you spoke of a possible license from the G.E. to export
lamps to certain countries. I don't know whether I explained
the situation to you, but the fact is that in the world at large,
the more important electrical interests, such as the G.E., Siemens
of Germany, Phillips of Holland, etc., are closely bound
together in a cartel with the result that they have entered into
binding agreements, apportioning world markets between the
respective companies. Accordingly "you can see that if the G.E.
broke their agreement and allowed us to export into a foreign
country which was assigned under the cartel agreement to a
European manufacturer, that European manufacturer would
have a claim to enter the American market in competition with
us and probably could not be restrained from doing so. This
is something which would probably not be to our advantage."

One might as well urge that a railway wreck promotes transportation
as to urge that a cartel agreement promotes trade.

The cartelist lives in a land of make-believe. I do not suppose
that we can object to anyone having his own private fairy
tale, but this kind of fairy tale can be dangerous to the future
peace and security of this country. It is a self-perpetuating fairy
tale. It is founded on economic maladjustments and it tends
to prolong these maladjustments by collecting a hidden tax
from consumers and by donating the proceeds to monopolists
who have no incentive to change their ways. The consequences
can be disastrous in both the military and the political sphere.
As for our own economic life, international cartels breed domestic
monopolies. Their final result is complete government
control and management of business.

The cartelist appears to believe that the way to engage in
foreign trade is to have a conference--a kind of Alice in Wonderland
mad tea party. At this conference the world is divided
up; markets are allocated; and, if he is fortunate, an American
enterpriser will be given some business. At the end of the
conference he can telephone his office and say "Men, we have
been given the Shangri-La market; it's all ours." Sometimes
the cartelist sounds as though he were too lazy to attend the
conference himself. He wants his Government to go for him.
He wants the Government to tell him what to do, what markets
he can have, and what he can sell. One gets the impression that
foreign trade is conducted in an armchair, that it is better if
you can get the Government to do it for you, and that it does
not make much difference what you have to sell.

This kind of thinking is dangerous. It is a denial of the principle
of private property with the profit reward for private
initiative and risk taking. Foreign trade presents special problems,
but it is none the less true in foreign as well as in domestic
trade that if you want to sell you have to make a product the
consumer wants to buy. In the development of the foreign
market there is no panacea, no easy substitute for ingenuity and
efficiency. We cannot expect the foreign consumer to adjust his
desires to whatever it is we want to sell. We have to make the
kind of a product he wants to buy. The truth of the matter is
that many of the large concerns that have made cartel agreements
have not been particularly anxious to sell in the foreign
market. They have been more anxious to keep independent
enterprise in this country from gaining access to foreign markets
than they were to sell themselves. As a consequence we must
frankly admit that in many industries, American enterprise has
not shown the competitive alertness it has at home. If it does
not show competitive alertness, it does not deserve the business.
And you cannot find a substitute for competitive alertness in an
armchair cartel conference or even in an intergovernmental
cartel conference.

The cartel conference is a kind of legislature, imposing hidden
taxes on consumers and bestowing bounties on others, without
the necessity for disclosure or responsibility to any electorate.
It is truly a method of imposing taxation without representation.
This is true in every cartel case. Some time ago it
was fashionable to scoff at international relief or development
projects as being international WPAs. Americans were asked
rhetorically whether they wished to take care of inhabitants on
some other portion of the globe. But no relief scheme has ever
been imagined, and no one would dare to present it, which could
begin to compare with the international relief societies maintained
for themselves by the international cartels. Gigantic sums
are drained from the American consumer each year and given
outright to domestic monopolists and to foreign companies operating
in protected markets. When it is urged that American
companies should be allowed to join with foreign cartels in
order to promote foreign trade, it should be remembered that
what is there called foreign trade is in reality a gigantic relief
enterprise supported by the American consumer. I can illustrate
this with an example taken from one of our earliest cartel cases.

The story begins prior to the First World War with the
discovery and development in Germany of a way of making
synthetic nitrate of soda by taking nitrogen out of the air. Prior
to that discovery, the world was dependent upon Chile for its
nitrate of soda for use in both fertilizer and the making of
munitions. The discovery of this new way of making nitrate of
soda changed the history of the world for it made it possible for
the Germans to wage war without depending upon a raw material
to be found only in the Western Hemisphere. It is probable
that if synthetic nitrogen had not been discovered, the
Germans could not have been able to go to war.

The Allies at that time were dependent upon Chilean nitrate
of soda, and as a military matter, this dependence made the
Allied position in the first years of the war exceedingly precarious.
The Germans knew that Great Britain could not stay
in the war for any considerable length of time if it were cut
off from its only source of nitrogen, and accordingly in 1917,
the Germans set up a blockade outside of Valparaiso. The first
attempt of the British to break this blockade was unsuccessful,
but the blockade was finally removed as a result of the battle
of the Falkland Islands when Admiral Von Spee was defeated.
As an economic matter, this dependence of the Allies upon
Chilean nitrate of soda was, of course, good for Chile. The
United States in 1917 and 1918 purchased almost four million
tons of nitrate from Chile; we paid on the average of about
$82.50 per ton. At one time, the price rose to $150.00 per ton.
In those days, Chile had a unique product, a natural monopoly,
and we had to pay for it. The First World War gave to Chile
the chance to receive large revenues on a valuable asset, but the
First World War also created a situation where in the days to
come that asset would depreciate enormously.

The asset of Chilean nitrate of soda was depreciated enormously
because all of the important countries of the world,
including our own, began to produce synthetic nitrate of soda.
Chile no longer had a natural monopoly safe from effective
competition. The producers of synthetic nitrate of soda began
to compete with each other and with the Chileans. In order
to remove this competition they formed a cartel.

The cartel was formed in 1926 and by 1938 it had reached its
full growth. The cartel was dominated in Europe by the so-called
DEN group, composed of Imperial Chemical Industries,
Ltd. for the British, Stickstoff-Syndikat, controlled by I. G.
Farbenindustrie for the Germans, and Norsk Hydro for the
Norwegians. The European end of the cartel formed an international
company in Switzerland to handle the cartel affairs,
and thus to represent the thirty-five principal European producers.
By special agreements the cartel was extended to cover
the Chilean producers of natural nitrate, and I am sorry to say,
the important American producers as well. The cartel was an
international combination to restrict production, maintain prices
and to allocate territories. The world was divided up into special
zones of influence; quotas were assigned, and sales in forbidden
areas or above the allowed quota resulted in the assessment
of penalties. Mexico, for instance, was allocated to the
German producers. The American producers were required to
refrain from exporting to certain areas. The Barrett Company
could not sell substantial quantities of nitrate of soda into foreign
markets reserved for the Chilean producers. Du Pont
was kept from selling a nitrogenous product in the Philippine
Islands. This was not an international trade agreement; as is
true with all cartel agreements, this was an agreement to
restrict trade.

The cartel agreements covered the American market. Imports
by a foreign company to this country had to be included
in determining whether that company had exceeded its quota
of the world market. American companies were restricted in
their exports and to some extent in their production. And sales
in the American market, whether for Chilean, European or
American producers were at agreed upon prices. An elaborate
system of distribution was worked out and adhered to so that
these agreed upon prices could be maintained down through
the wholesalers and retailers. The cartel thus reached down and
touched the American farmer buying in the country store.

Now nitrate of soda is important to the American farmer as
are the other fertilizer nitrogen products which were covered
by this cartel. In 1937, approximately 700,000 tons of nitrate
of soda were imported from Chile for distribution to the American
farmer. If there is a cartel in fertilizer nitrogen, it is the
American farmer who pays. And he has paid in millions of dollars--a
hidden tax to the foreign and domestic producers.

Production was restricted and prices were fixed by this cartel.
Some of the higher prices went to Chile; some of them went
to our own producers and abroad. The consumer, who in this
country happened to be the American farmer, paid a tax in the
form of higher prices to keep this cartel going. He did not
know he was paying this tax. He did not have the opportunity
to elect a representative who might have been for or against
this tax. And yet, out of every dollar the farmer paid, a part
of it was an involuntary offering to the cartel.

And what was the good from all of this? A hidden tax was
collected; purchasing power was destroyed. And all of this
was done so that productive capacity could go unused. Out of
the hidden tax paid by the American farmer, only a part of it
went to the Chilean companies; a good deal of it went to American
and European producers.

Whenever the argument is made that a cartel supports a distress
industry, the complete answer is that it would be cheaper
and better to make an outright gift, raised, if necessary, by lawful
general taxation through the Congress. It would be cheaper
because consumers would not be required to pay an additional
amount to those who are not distressed as they have to do when
the cartel keeps the general price up. It would be better because
if it were a gift, it would not be raised from only one
group of consumers, as in this case, the farmers. It would be
better because the contributors to the gift fund would have some
chance to know what they were doing and to decide whether
they wanted to do it. Nor would the gift be as likely to disappear
under the burden of an inefficient method of production
as is the case with the hidden tax which is collected every year
and which imposes no incentive upon the monopolist to change
his ways. You cannot expect the monopolist to change his ways
when he can collect a hidden tax every year. No doubt after
this war, it will be argued that synthetic nitrogen capacity should
go unused by agreement between the large companies. We
should remember that if this is done, as with all cartel agreements,
there is a hidden and unlawful tax; in this case it would
be the American farmers who would pay.

I do not revive this synthetic nitrogen story in order to make
charges, but merely as a specific illustration of the way cartels
operate. The actual cases are the best answers to the argument
that cartels promote trade. The synthetic nitrogen cartel was
typical in many ways. The particular occasion for the birth of
this cartel was the development of a synthetic process which
threatened to destroy the capital value of a natural product.
After this war, there will be many new processes whose existence
will destroy old capital values and which can be looked
upon either as keys to open the doors of new opportunities or as
occasions for restrictive agreements. The synthetic nitrogen
cartel brought together producers fearful of each other's productive
capacity. As is true in almost every important cartel,
the restrictive agreements might have had important military
consequences, even though many of the private producers were
only thinking in terms of a peace-time market. And finally, this
foreign cartel, as is so frequently the case, bred a domestic cartel.

The effect is far-reaching both politically and economically.
You can never deal with just one cartel separate from the others
because the cartel world is an intricate and interrelated maze.
Thus the foreign participants in the nitrogen cartel include the
German I. G. Farbenindustrie and the British Imperial Chemical
Industries--each a member of a variety of world dividing
cartels. The American producers, whether they knew it or not,
were entering into an international game to divide markets in
which every market and every type of product was involved if
the full scope of the cartel agreements of their partners were
revealed. They were dealing in secret international diplomacy.

In many cases they were in reality dealing with foreign governments,
despite the fact that it has not been the policy of this
country to have the conduct of our foreign affairs in private
hands. Since 1799 an Act of Congress has prohibited every citizen
of the United States, without the permission of the Government,
from carrying on any written or verbal correspondence
or intercourse with any foreign government with an intent to
influence the measures or conduct of any foreign government
in relation to any disputes or controversies with the United
States. Quite apart from whether this criminal statute is applicable,
its spirit would deny to any citizen the right to barter
away the trade of the United States by agreement with a foreign
government.

One need only think of the possible disastrous effects of permitting
Germany to build up a monopoly position in Latin
America. The economic effects grow like a snow-ball. Thus in
the instance of the synthetic nitrogen cartel, the American consumer
lost purchasing power; that meant that American producers
could sell less and could therefore buy less. The Chileans
received only a portion of the amount of money taken out
of purchasing power, but the related cartels operate in Chile,
such as the chemical cartel of which both Imperial Chemical
Industries and du Pont's are members. And these cartels do
the same thing to Chile that the synthetic nitrogen cartel did
to us. Economic life is so related today that you cannot restrict
one part and not have almost endless repercussions. For instance,
if American movies should be kept out of foreign areas, the
effect is immediate on all kinds of American products which
are advertised continually through the medium of the motion
picture. If the motion picture producers enter into a cartel
agreement, they are restricting a good deal of American trade
in addition to their own.

What then is the solution? There is no solution if the problem
is how can you have American firms enter into foreign
cartel agreements but not restrict American trade and commerce.
It is surely no solution to say that in the future we
will have the governments enter into cartel agreements for us.
As an economic matter, it makes no difference whether an agreement
to restrict trade is private or governmental. As a political
matter, I would agree that if we are going to have such agreements,
with their widespread economic diseases, they had better
be the responsibility of the government, if only because, the
government which makes such agreements can be changed by
the voters. But I would suggest that effective governmental
control over such agreements would require such a degree of
interferences and surveillance over private industry as to place
in great jeopardy our own free enterprise-private property system.
The history of attempts to control cartels by legalizing
and controlling them is not particularly inspiring. Germany is
one example.

There is not any one solution because there is not just one
problem. There are many things which must and can be done
if this country is to encourage foreign trade.

<i>First</i>, we must encourage domestic research. Any country
which wishes to engage in trade and commerce in the future
industrial era must develop its own laboratories and encourage
its own domestic research. It has sometimes been suggested that
the reason why some of our larger American companies entered
into agreements to stay out of important markets such as Latin
America was because such was the price they had to pay to
get the benefits of European research. It has sometimes even
been suggested that we have been dependent upon European
research acquired in this manner for many of the important
developments which have helped us in this war.

There will probably always be a certain amount of obscurity
about this claim that we are dependent upon European research.
The files of some of the Antitrust Division cases, however, indicate
that even though German firms may have been bound
under their agreements to make their research available to their
American friends, in many important instances they did not
do so. In any event, I think we would agree that it is of the
utmost importance that American firms be able to stand on their
own feet, and that they should not be dependent upon research
from abroad. It has been quite natural, of course, for European
research to be in advance of our own in some fields. But failure
to develop our own laboratories and our own scientists would
be criminal negligence.

I suggest that we ought to have an impartial and searching
survey begun as soon as possible as to American research facilities
and the state of American research. This is not a matter
which concerns only our foreign trade. It goes to the very heart
of our future domestic wellbeing.

Of course, I do not mean to suggest that we should cut ourselves
off from European research. There is every reason to
believe that research in the future will be truly international
in the sense that a partial discovery in England will be supplemented
by work done in France or in this country. Possibly
some inter-governmental agency can be developed which will
act as a kind of international clearing house in order to speed
the development of common research carried on in separate
areas. It is likely that private institutions in this country and
the government itself, as suggested by Senator Kilgore, could
aid in the performing of this function. If a study were made
of our own domestic research facilities, I would expect that out
of that study a recommendation might well come to set up some
kind of an international clearing house for research.

There is a further step we can take. The research which has
been developed in Germany during the last ten years under
the Nazi regime is research which in right belongs to the people
of the United Nations. It was Nazi government sponsored research
used for the purpose of making war upon us. It is research
which should now be put to use for the general good of
mankind. It should not be considered as belonging to private
hands either in Germany or elsewhere. The United Nations
should make sure that steps are taken to make available this
research so that it can be used generally.

<i>Second</i>, we must remove, through inter-governmental action,
the waste and misuse of resources which occur when industries
cannot compete and are artificially maintained. It will be much
cheaper for this country to offer transitional credit to be used
to develop new industries than to continue paying hidden taxes
which don't accomplish anything. We should set up an international
mechanism whereby substantial credit can be made
available to other countries upon such terms as will encourage
the readjustment of the use of their resources so that these resources
can be employed, without the crutch of a trade barrier,
in the free trade of the world. Consistent with this aim, we can
urge also the adoption of minimum wage and health standards
so that labor exploitation does not become the means of providing
a hidden subsidy for industry in countries having substandard
labor conditions.

<i>Third</i>, it is, of course, imperative that this country make
known its determination to encourage foreign trade and to
make it possible for American firms, large and small, to bring
their goods to the consumers who will buy. Through vigorous
antitrust action, we can break up the activities of a great number
of foreign cartels. And American firms are perfectly capable
of engaging in vigorous competition with the old monopolistic
companies of Europe. Where American industry is competitive
at home, such as the automobile industry, there is no way a
foreign company effectively can keep out American goods, and
foreign consumers would be the first to object if that were
tried. It is the industries which are monopolistically dominated
at home which seem to have the greatest difficulty. I suspect,
however, that in those industries there are smaller firms who
will be glad to have the opportunity of selling abroad.

<i>Fourth</i>, we should stand ready to help create an international
forum to which countries denied access to raw materials or
allowed to purchase them only on the basis of monopolistic
prices can go to present their case. This does not mean that
we should take part in any international control of business, but
it does mean that for those few areas where monopolies continue
to persist, we must create a world where there is a remedy within
the structure of the peace. Many of these raw materials no
longer have their former importance. Poetic justice may come
to rubber, quinine and eventually to diamonds. Persistence in
monopoly prices usually stimulates the development of a substitute.
The international forum which I urge will probably not
have to hear too many cases. The power of competition has
grown more powerful during the war because of the development
of myriads of substitutes for the key raw materials.

The opportunities are tremendous. The tools needed for the
job are the productive facilities and materials which we will
have in abundance. We can play our part with energy and
initiative; we would not have it otherwise. We believe in competition,
and we are ready to compete. We are ready to engage
wholeheartedly in rebuilding a world of peace in which every
man and every country can have a stake. We know that we
cannot maintain, let alone advance our standard of living save
upon the basis of an active and expanding international trade.
Our expanding trade will enlarge the area of the interests which
we have in common with other peoples, and for us, as well
as for them, will narrow the intensity of our differences. And
we will have played our part in foreign trade in such a way as
to preserve the symbol of our political and economic democracy.




APPENDIX I

<i>Recent Cases</i>


The most effective weapon presently available for combatting
the influence of monopoly and cartel-minded international
groups is vigorous enforcement of the antitrust laws. Congress
has recognized that the natural effect of competition is to increase
commerce--to extinguish or prevent the free play of
competition is to hinder commerce. As was stated by Mr. Chief
Justice Stone in the <i>Trenton Potteries</i> case:

"Whatever difference of opinion there may be among economists
as to the social and economic desirability of an unrestrained
competitive system, it cannot be doubted that the Sherman
Law and the judicial decisions interpreting it are based
upon the assumption that the public interest is best protected
from the evils of monopoly and price control by the maintenance
of competition."

By passage of the antitrust laws, Congress has expressed the
American policy of free competition not only in interstate trade
and commerce but also in our foreign trade and commerce. The
provisions of Section 73 of the Wilson Tariff Act further exemplify
this doctrine with specific reference to imports to this
country. Section 11 of the Panama Canal Act prohibits passage
through the Panama Canal of ships owned or operated by
persons doing business in violation of the antitrust laws. Thus,
the practices of foreign cartels, involving elimination of competition
and collectivization of industry, are inconsonant with
the basic concepts of our antitrust laws and national economic
policy. The type of arrangements which are the cornerstone of
European cartelization, such as agreements dividing markets,
allocating customers, controlling production and prices, and
apportioning business have all been long declared to be in violation
of our antitrust statutes by the courts.

By and large, the antitrust laws can be effectively applied to
combat restraints upon the domestic and foreign commerce of
the United States whether the practices, agreements or conspiracies
complained of have their inception in this country or
elsewhere.

It has become an accepted principle of law that acts done or
agreements entered into in a foreign jurisdiction, even though
lawful there, may be prosecuted or enjoined in this country
where the effect or result of such acts or agreements is a violation
of our laws. This principle has been applied in antitrust
cases, and agreements which restrain our trade with foreign
nations have been uniformly declared illegal. Our courts
may control foreign citizens or corporations operating wholly
in foreign territory, where their operations extend into the
domestic and foreign commerce of this country, just as we may
undoubtedly control the activities of our own citizens and our
own corporations which impinge upon our domestic and foreign
trade and commerce.

The mere fact that a combination is formed in a foreign
country does not prevent the application of our laws where
it affects the foreign commerce of this country and is put into
operation here. Conversely, combinations or agreements entered
into in the United States and adversely affecting the foreign
trade of this country are subject to the antitrust laws even
though the acts done to effectuate the restraints are performed
outside this country. It is recognized that some cartel arrangements
are instigated by or under cover of foreign governmental
authority, but unless the cartel arrangements complained of are
solely participated in by the foreign government, the situation
is not altered.

While a foreign sovereign may have immunity from suit,
such immunity does not apply to private individuals or organizations
even though they may be acting pursuant to the laws
of their own country, or as agents for their government or
though a foreign government may have a substantial financial
interest in the challenged organization and activities.

The practical difficulty of acquiring personal jurisdiction over
some of the foreign individual or corporate participants in a
cartel which affects our foreign or domestic commerce is often
confused with the question of whether or not a violation of
our antitrust laws is involved. This, however, is a technical
problem depending upon an aggregation of facts rather than
a question of substantive law involved in restraints upon commerce.
